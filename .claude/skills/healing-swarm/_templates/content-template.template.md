## Voice Guidelines

### Language

**DO:**
- "You might notice..." (invitational)
- "Some people find..." (normalizing variety)
- "Research suggests..." (evidence-grounded)
- "In this tradition..." (attribution)

**DON'T:**
- "You will feel..." (promising outcomes)
- "This will cure..." (medical claims)
- "Ancient secrets..." (mystification without sources)
- "Just relax..." (invalidating difficulty)
