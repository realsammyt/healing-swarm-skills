## Overview

[2-3 sentences describing the healing circle or group practice.
What it offers. What it does NOT involve (not therapy, not pressure
to share). Evidence level.]

> **Note:** Community healing practices can produce powerful

## Facilitator Preparation

### Before the Circle

**Space:**
- Arrange seating in a circle (chairs, cushions, or mixed)
- Ensure all participants can see each other
- Remove or cover distractions (screens, clutter)
- Have water, tissues, and a quiet adjacent space available
- Lighting: warm, not harsh
- Temperature: comfortable

**Materials:**
- Talking piece (any meaningful object that can be held and passed)
- Timer or timekeeper role
- [Practice-specific materials]
- Facilitator script/notes (this document)

**Personal preparation:**
1. Complete your own centering practice (5-10 minutes)
2. Review the full protocol
3. Prepare for emotional scenarios (distress, conflict, silence)
4. If co-facilitating, brief your co-facilitator on roles
5. Set your intention: "I am here to hold space, not to lead
   experience"

### Facilitator Role Reminders

- You hold the container — you do NOT participate in the practice
- Monitor for distress, power dynamics, and boundary violations
- Manage time gently but firmly
- Redirect if someone gives unsolicited advice to another
- Be prepared to pause or end the session if safety requires it
- Your groundedness sets the tone for the group

---

## Group Consent Framework

### Consent Script (Read Aloud)

**Facilitator says:**

"Welcome to [Circle Name]. Before we begin, I want to be clear
about what this involves and what your rights are.

This practice involves [brief, concrete description of what will
happen]. It is a contemplative community practice, not therapy
or group counseling.

**Your rights in this circle:**

- You may pass on any sharing prompt — no explanation needed
- You may leave at any time — no explanation needed
- What you share here stays here — confidentiality is everyone's
  responsibility
- You own your experience — no one will interpret or evaluate it
- You may ask for what you need at any time
- Physical boundaries: no uninvited touch

**What this practice is NOT:**
- Not therapy or group counseling
- Not a place to process active crisis or severe trauma
- Not a space where anyone will be pressured to share
- Not a performance — there is no audience

If you feel distressed at any point, raise your hand or place
down the talking piece, and I will step aside with you.

Does everyone consent to participate under these guidelines?"

[Wait for explicit verbal consent from EACH participant]
[Anyone who does not consent is welcomed to observe silently
or to leave without judgment]

---

## Confidentiality Agreement

### Verbal Agreement (Read Aloud, Confirmed by All)

**Facilitator says:**

"Before we enter the circle, we establish confidentiality.

**What stays in the circle:**
- Other people's stories and experiences
- Who said what
- Personal details shared by others
- Anything you would not want shared about yourself

**What you MAY share outside:**
- Your own experience and feelings
- General impressions ('It was meaningful to me')
- That you participated (unless you prefer privacy)

This is not a rule I am imposing — it is an agreement we make
together. Confidentiality is what makes this space safe.

Can everyone commit to this?"

[Wait for explicit verbal agreement from each participant]

---

## Circle Opening ([X] minutes)

### Grounding Practice (Shared)

[A brief, accessible grounding practice done together. This
creates the shared container and settles the group.]

**Facilitator leads:**
"[Grounding script — simple, body-based, accessible to all.
Example: three breaths together, feet on the ground, eyes
closed or soft gaze.]"

### Intention Setting

**Facilitator says:**
"[Brief framing of the circle's intention — what we are here
for, without prescribing what should happen.]"

### Guidelines Review

**Facilitator says:**
"A few guidelines for our time together:

1. **Speak from 'I'** — Share your own experience, not advice
   for others
2. **Listen without fixing** — When someone shares, simply
   receive it. No advice, no interpretation, no comparison
3. **Pass freely** — You may always say 'I pass' with no
   explanation
4. **One voice** — When the talking piece is with someone,
   they have the floor
5. **Confidentiality** — As we agreed
6. **Respect time** — Be mindful of sharing time so all
   voices are heard

These guidelines protect everyone. They are not restrictions —
they are the container that makes depth possible."

## Core Group Practice ([X] minutes)

### [Practice Phase 1] ([X] minutes)

**Facilitator says:**
"[Script for first phase]"

**Participants do:**
[Clear instruction]

**Facilitation notes:**
- [What to watch for]
- [How to handle common issues]
- [When to intervene]

---

### [Practice Phase 2] ([X] minutes)

**Facilitator says:**
"[Script for core practice]"

**Participants do:**
[Step-by-step instruction]

**If someone becomes distressed:**
1. Pause the circle gently: "Let's take a breath together"
2. Make eye contact with the distressed person
3. Offer: "Would you like to step out with me for a moment?"
4. If they say yes, co-facilitator (or the group in silence)
   holds the space while you step out
5. Run grounding: feet on floor, three breaths, name three
   things you see
6. No pressure to return to the circle
7. Check in after the session

**Facilitator watches for:**
- Participants who seem overwhelmed but are not speaking up
- One person dominating sharing time
- Advice-giving disguised as sharing
- Physical tension, withdrawal, or visible distress
- Power dynamics playing out in who speaks and who doesn't

---

### [Practice Phase 3] ([X] minutes)

[Additional phases as needed]

---

## Circle Closing ([X] minutes)

### Closing Round (Optional)

**Facilitator says:**
"We are coming to the close of our circle. If you would like,
you may share one word or one sentence about what you are
carrying away from this time. You may also pass."

[Pass the talking piece around the circle]

### Closing Ritual

[A brief, shared closing practice. Examples: shared breath,
moment of silence, bell, each person speaks one word,
facilitator offers a brief reading or reflection.]

### Confidentiality Reminder

**Facilitator says:**
"As we leave this circle, remember: your experience is yours
to carry. Others' experiences stay here. Thank you for your
trust and your presence."

### Grounding and Re-Entry

**Facilitator says:**
"Before you stand, take a moment to ground yourself.

Feel your feet on the floor. Take a breath. Look around the
room. Notice the people here — the ordinary, human reality
of this moment.

When you are ready, you may stand and move gently. There is
no rush to return to your day."

---

## Debrief Protocol ([X] minutes)

### For Participants (Optional)

**If offered (5-10 minutes after closing):**
- "What was it like to be in this circle?"
- "Is there anything you want to name before we go?"
- "Is there anything you need?"

**Guidelines:**
- Sharing is optional — always
- No evaluating whose experience was "better"
- No interpreting another person's experience
- "I noticed..." language, not "You seemed..."

### For Facilitator (Private, After Participants Leave)

- What went well?
- What was challenging?
- Was anyone in distress? Do they need follow-up?
- Were any guidelines tested or violated? How was it handled?
- What would I do differently?
- How am I feeling right now? Do I need grounding or support?

---

## Facilitator Self-Care Section

**Facilitators absorb the emotional energy of the group.
Self-care is required, not optional.**

### Immediately After

1. Sit in the circle space alone for 2-3 minutes
2. Run your own grounding practice
3. Drink water
4. If co-facilitating, debrief with your co-facilitator

### Within 24 Hours

  you trust)

- Reach out to a peer facilitator or supervisor if needed

### Ongoing

## Contraindications for Group Settings

**Group healing practices may NOT be appropriate for:**

- Individuals in acute mental health crisis
- Individuals with active psychosis or severe dissociation
- Individuals with severe social anxiety that would make group
  participation distressing (not healing)
- Individuals who have recently experienced interpersonal
  trauma and may be re-triggered by group vulnerability
- Situations where significant power imbalances exist between
  participants (employer/employee, etc.) without adequate
  safeguards
- Individuals who are actively intoxicated

**When in doubt:** Individual practice first. Group practice
when the person is stable and willing.

## Variations

### For smaller groups (2-3 people)
[Adapted version — more intimate, less structure needed,
but consent still required]

### For larger groups (12+)
[Adapted version — breakout groups, multiple facilitators,
more structure]

### For online/virtual circles
[Adapted version — camera/audio guidelines, digital consent,
chat protocols, breakout rooms]

### If the circle goes flat
[What to do if participants don't engage — simplify,
shorten, return to shared silence]

### For specific themes
[Grief circles, gratitude circles, transition circles,
intention circles — theme-specific adaptations]
```
