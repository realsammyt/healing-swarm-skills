## Overview

[2-3 sentences describing this specific sound practice, its tradition
of origin, and its purpose. Include evidence level.]

> **Evidence note:** Research on sound-based practices suggests
> physiological effects including vagal nerve stimulation through
> humming (Kalyani et al. 2011, n=12), respiratory pacing through
> rhythmic chanting, and potential oxytocin release during group
> singing. Individual responses vary. Most studies have small sample
> sizes; larger-scale research is ongoing.

## Tradition Attribution

[Name the tradition of origin with specificity. Include dates, primary
sources, and any adaptations made from the traditional form.]

**Example:**
> This practice is adapted from *Bhramari pranayama* (bee breath),
> documented in the Hatha Yoga Pradipika (15th century CE) and rooted
> in earlier Vedic breath and sound traditions (c. 1500 BCE). We honor
> the lineages that have preserved and transmitted this practice. Our
> adaptation simplifies the traditional form for accessibility while
> maintaining its core principles.

**Open/Closed status:** [State whether this practice is open or requires
lineage transmission. If uncertain, do not include the practice.]

## Safety — Read Before Every Session

### Volume and Hearing
- Practice at a **comfortable volume** — sound healing should never hurt
- If you wear **hearing aids**, remove or adjust them before proximity
  to singing bowls or sustained toning
- If you have **tinnitus**, use only soft humming; avoid singing bowls
  near the head

### Environment
- Practice in a **quiet, comfortable space** where you can make sound
  without self-consciousness
- Seated position recommended (chair, cushion, or floor)
- Optional: water nearby for throat comfort

### Contraindications — Do Not Practice Vigorous Chanting If You Have:
- Active ear infection or recent ear surgery
- Vocal cord conditions (nodules, polyps, laryngitis)
- Severe sound sensitivity or hyperacusis
- Recent jaw or dental surgery
- Active respiratory infection with sore throat
- Any condition your healthcare provider has advised against vocal exercise

### Stop Immediately If You Experience:
- Ear pain or sudden hearing changes
- Persistent dizziness or vertigo
- Voice pain or loss during practice
- Chest pain or difficulty breathing
- Severe headache
- New ringing in ears that was not present before

*If you have any medical conditions, consult your healthcare provider
before beginning this practice.*

## Before You Begin

### You'll Need
- [Duration] of uninterrupted time
- A comfortable seated position
- A space where you feel comfortable making sound
- Optional: [specific equipment — mala, singing bowl, reference tone]

### Preparation
1. Sit in a comfortable position — spine upright but not rigid
2. Relax your jaw — let your lips part slightly
3. Roll your shoulders back and release tension in your neck
4. Take 3 natural breaths to settle
5. [If mantra: pronunciation guide here]

---

## The Practice

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Gently prepare your voice and throat with soft humming.

**How to do it:**
1. Close your lips gently and begin humming at any comfortable pitch
2. There is no correct pitch — let your body find what resonates
3. Place one hand on your chest to feel the vibration
4. Hum through 3-5 slow exhales
5. Notice where you feel the vibration — chest, throat, face, sinuses

**What you might notice:**
- Warmth or tingling in your chest, throat, or face
- Your jaw and throat relaxing
- A natural settling of your breathing rhythm

*If your voice cracks or wavers, that's completely normal. This is not
a performance.*

---

### Core Practice — [Practice Name] ([N] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
[Description of the core sound practice]

**How to do it:**
1. [Specific sound instruction — pitch, syllable, rhythm]
2. [Breath coordination — "Let the sound ride your exhale"]
3. [Volume guidance — "Moderate volume, no straining"]
4. [Rhythm/pacing — "One cycle per natural breath"]
5. [Body awareness — "Notice where the vibration resonates"]
6. [Repetition guidance — counting, mala, or duration-based]

**Sound guidance:**
- **Pitch:** Self-selected. Find a comfortable range — not too high,
  not too low
- **Rhythm:** Follow your natural breath rhythm. The sound fills
  your exhale
- **Volume:** Moderate. You should be able to sustain this without
  throat strain
- **Resonance:** Notice where in your body you feel the vibration most —
  this is your resonance point for today

**What you might notice:**
- Vibration spreading through your body
- Deepening calm or focus
- Emotional release (tears, sighing, laughter — all normal)
- Sense of spaciousness or warmth
- Time distortion (feeling like more or less time has passed)

*Every few minutes, pause for 20-30 seconds of silence. Listen.
Notice how your body feels in the quiet after sound.*

---

### [Repeat or vary core practice sections as needed]

---

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Gradually transition from sound to silence.

**How to do it:**
1. Gradually reduce your volume — let the sound become softer
2. Transition from [mantra/toning] to simple humming
3. Let the humming become softer still
4. Allow the last hum to fade into silence naturally
5. Sit in the silence for 30-60 seconds
6. Notice the quality of silence after sound

**What you might notice:**
- Heightened awareness of ambient sound
- Deep calm or stillness
- Body feeling warm, relaxed, or energized
- The silence feeling "fuller" than before the practice

*The silence after sound is part of the practice. Don't rush past it.*

---

### Closing

**What you'll do:**
Ground yourself and transition back to daily awareness.

**How to do it:**
1. Return to natural breathing
2. Feel the weight of your body on the surface beneath you
3. Notice your feet on the floor (or legs on the cushion)
4. Gently move your fingers and toes
5. When ready, open your eyes softly
6. Take a sip of water if available

**What you might notice:**
- Deep relaxation or heightened alertness
- Emotional tenderness or calm
- Your voice feeling different (warmer, clearer)
- Or: nothing notable — all responses are valid

*Take a gentle moment before moving on with your day.*

## Evidence Box

> **What research suggests:** [Specific claim relevant to this practice]
>
> **Evidence:** [Study type, sample size, key finding]
>
> **Limitations:** [Sample size, methodology notes, replication status]
>
> **Source:** [Citation with PMID/DOI where available]

**Standard evidence for humming/toning practices:**

> **What research suggests:** Humming may stimulate vagal tone and
> promote parasympathetic activation.
>
> **Evidence:** Kalyani et al. (2011) found that "Om" chanting
> produced limbic deactivation patterns similar to vagal nerve
> stimulation in an fMRI study (n=12). Separate research suggests
> that humming increases nasal nitric oxide production (Weitzberg &
> Lundberg 2002, n=10).
>
> **Limitations:** Small sample sizes. Most studies examine single
> sessions rather than sustained practice. Mechanisms are not yet
> fully understood.

## Variations

### If this feels too intense
- Switch to listening only (play a reference tone or bowl recording)
- Hum with lips barely together (softer vibration)
- Reduce duration to 3-5 minutes of sounding
- Take longer silence intervals between sounding
- Stop at any point — partial practice counts

### If you want to deepen the practice
- Extend core practice duration (15-20 minutes)
- Explore different pitches and notice how resonance shifts
- Add mala counting for mantra practice (108 repetitions)
- Try with eyes closed for deeper inward focus
- Practice at the same time each day for consistency

### For voice sensitivity or limitation
- Listening-only variation (no vocal production)
- Whispered mantra (subvocal repetition)
- Very soft humming — barely audible
- Focus on internal vibration, not audible sound

### For different times of day
- **Morning:** Energizing — brighter tones, slightly more volume
- **Midday:** Reset — 5 minutes of humming, brief silence
- **Evening:** Calming — lower pitch, softer volume, longer silence

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Suggestion |
|-------|------------|
| "I can't find a comfortable pitch" | Start by sighing with sound ("Ahhhh") and notice where your voice naturally lands. That's your pitch for today |
| Throat feels scratchy | Drink water, reduce volume, or switch to listening-only. Don't push through throat discomfort |
| Feeling self-conscious about the sound | Try practicing alone first. Remind yourself: this is not singing, there is no audience, there is no wrong sound |
| Lightheaded after extended toning | Normal if mild. Pause, breathe normally for a minute, then continue at reduced intensity. Extended sound naturally extends exhale, which can lower CO2 |
| No sensations at all | This is fine. Effects can be subtle or build over sessions. Focus on the practice, not the sensation |
| Emotional release (crying, etc.) | Normal and healthy. Sound can release stored tension. Allow it, then return to the practice when ready |
| Ears ringing after practice | Reduce volume significantly next session. If ringing persists or was not present before, consult a healthcare provider |

## Journal Prompt

After your practice, you might reflect on:

- Where in your body did you feel the most vibration today?
- How did the quality of silence change after the sound practice?
- What emotions, if any, arose during the practice?
- How does your body feel now compared to before?

*Journaling is optional. There is no requirement to report a particular
experience.*

---

## Building a Practice

**Frequency:** 3-5 times per week is supportive. Daily practice is
ideal if it feels sustainable.

**Timeline:** Allow 1-2 weeks to feel comfortable producing sound.
Most people notice shifts in body awareness and relaxation within
2-3 weeks of regular practice.

**Progression:**
- Week 1-2: Listening and gentle humming ([beginner parameters])
- Week 3-4: Humming and simple toning
- Month 2+: [Mantra or chanting progression if applicable]
- Ongoing: Deepen awareness, explore traditions, extend duration

## Element Guidelines

### Safety Section

**Purpose:** Ensure hearing and vocal safety before every session

**Requirements:**
- Volume guidance (comfortable, never straining)
- Hearing condition screening (tinnitus, hearing aids, ear conditions)
- Vocal condition screening (throat conditions, recent surgery)
- Red flag symptoms for sound-specific adverse effects
- Medical disclaimer

**This section must NEVER be shortened, softened, or made optional.**
It appears in every protocol, every time.

### Warm-Up Phase

**Purpose:** Prepare the voice and throat gently

**Key principles:**
- Start with humming (lowest barrier to entry)
- Self-selected pitch (never prescribed)
- Jaw and throat relaxation
- Vibrotactile awareness (hand on chest)
- Permission for voice imperfection

**Language:**
- "At whatever pitch feels comfortable" not "Hum at middle C"

- "Let your voice warm up naturally" not "Sing scales to prepare"

### Core Practice Phase

**Purpose:** Guide the primary sound practice

**Key principles:**
- Clear sound instruction (what to say/hum/chant)
- Breath-sound coordination
- Volume at comfortable level
- Body awareness cues (resonance location)
- Periodic silence intervals for integration
- No musical performance standards

**Language:**
- "Let the sound fill your exhale" not "Sustain the note for 10 seconds"
- "Notice where you feel the vibration" not "Direct the sound to your third eye"
- "Find your own rhythm" not "Match this exact tempo"

### Silence Intervals

**Purpose:** Integration between sounding

**Key principles:**
- Include silence after every 3-5 minutes of sounding
- 20-30 seconds minimum
- Guide attention to body sensations during silence
- Frame silence as part of the practice, not absence of practice

### Evidence Notes

**Purpose:** Honest framing of the research basis

**Required in every protocol:**
- Tradition named with specificity and dates
- Open/closed practice status stated
- Key study citations with sample sizes
- "Studies suggest" not "science proves"
