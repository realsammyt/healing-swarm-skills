# [Practice Name]: Sleep Healing Practice

**Type:** [Wind-Down / Bedtime Meditation / Dream Work]
**Optimal Time:** [Evening — specify minutes before bed]
**Duration:** [X minutes]
**Level:** [Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced]
**Best for:** [What this practice supports]

---

## Overview

[2-3 sentences describing this specific sleep practice and its place
within the evening healing framework. Include evidence level.]

> **Evidence note:** Sleep hygiene interventions have a strong evidence
> base. CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) is the gold
> standard first-line treatment for chronic insomnia. Components adapted
> here — stimulus control, relaxation training, and sleep restriction
> concepts — are supported by systematic reviews. Individual responses
> to specific practices vary.

## Medical Disclaimer

**If you experience persistent insomnia (difficulty sleeping 3 or more
nights per week for 3 or more months), consult a sleep medicine
specialist.** CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) is the
recommended first-line treatment for chronic insomnia and is more
effective than sleep medication for long-term outcomes.

*This practice supports your body's natural sleep process. It does not
replace medical evaluation or treatment for sleep disorders.*

## Safety — Read Before Every Session

### Contraindications — Consult a Specialist If You Have:
- Narcolepsy (some relaxation practices may trigger cataplexy)
- Parasomnia (sleepwalking, sleep eating, REM behavior disorder)
- Untreated obstructive sleep apnea
- Dissociative disorders (dream work and lucid dreaming contraindicated)
- Active psychosis or psychotic features
- Severe PTSD with trauma-related nightmares (seek IRT — Imagery
  Rehearsal Therapy — with a trained therapist)

### Screen Safety
- **Dark mode mandatory** for any screen-delivered practice
- Minimum screen brightness with warm color temperature
- **Auto-shutoff** after practice completion — the screen must turn off
- Audio-only mode recommended when possible
- Consider printing this practice or memorizing the key steps

### Stop or Modify If You Experience:
- Increased anxiety or racing thoughts during the practice
- Distressing imagery during visualization or dream work
- Feeling of being "trapped" in relaxation (open eyes, sit up, ground)
- Worsening sleep after 2+ weeks of consistent practice (consult a
  sleep specialist — the practice may not be addressing the root cause)

*If this feels overwhelming at any point, open your eyes, feel your
feet on the floor, and take a few normal breaths. Rest is enough.*

## Tradition Attribution

[Name the tradition(s) this practice draws from with specificity.
Include dates, key texts, and lineage acknowledgment.]

**Example:**
> This practice draws from Tibetan dream yoga traditions, part of the
> Six Yogas of Naropa (11th century CE), adapted for accessibility.
> Traditional dream yoga is a sophisticated contemplative practice
> requiring extensive foundation in meditation and guidance from a
> qualified teacher. This adaptation simplifies the preparatory
> elements while honoring the tradition's understanding of sleep
> as a practice opportunity.

## Environment Preparation

### Room Setup
- **Temperature:** 60-67°F / 15-19°C (cool room supports sleep onset)
- **Lighting:** Dim warm light only. No overhead lights. Consider
  candlelight (battery-operated for safety) or a low-wattage warm bulb
- **Sound:** Quiet environment, or consistent ambient sound (fan, white
  noise, nature sounds)
- **Devices:** Phone on Do Not Disturb. Screen face-down or in another
  room. If using for this practice: dark mode, auto-shutoff set
- **Bed:** Clean, comfortable bedding. Bed reserved for sleep and
  intimacy only (stimulus control principle)

### You'll Need
- [Duration] of uninterrupted time
- Comfortable sleep clothing
- Bed or sleep surface ready
- Optional: journal and pen beside bed (for morning dream notes)
- Optional: warm herbal tea (chamomile, passionflower, valerian)
- Optional: calming scent (lavender — traditional, mild evidence)

---

## Pre-Sleep Routine

### 60 Minutes Before Bed
[Transition activities — closing the day, dimming lights, reducing
stimulation. Specific to this practice.]

### 30 Minutes Before Bed
[Calming activities — gentle movement, warm beverage, quiet reading.
Specific to this practice.]

### 15 Minutes Before Bed
[Pre-sleep ritual — breathing practice, body preparation, intention
setting. Specific to this practice.]

---

## The Practice

### Phase 1: Arrival (2-3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Settle into bed and acknowledge the transition from waking to rest.

**How to do it:**
1. Lie in your preferred sleep position
2. Take 3-5 slow breaths, emphasizing a long, gentle exhale
3. Acknowledge: "The day is complete. I can set it down."
4. Allow your eyes to close when they feel ready

**What you might notice:**
- Mind still active with the day's events (normal — don't fight it)
- Body still holding tension (normal — the next phase will address this)
- Resistance to slowing down (also normal — just notice it)

*There is no urgency. Rest is the practice, whether or not sleep comes.*

---

### Phase 2: Body Scan Relaxation ([X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Progressively invite relaxation through your body.

**How to do it:**
1. Begin at [crown / feet — specify direction]
2. Bring gentle attention to each area, noticing without changing
3. Invite softening: "My forehead softens... my jaw releases..."
4. Move slowly — spending 2-3 breaths with each area
5. [Specific body scan sequence for this practice]

**What you might notice:**
- Areas of unexpected tension (normal — just notice and invite softening)
- Warmth or heaviness (autogenic response — welcome)
- Mind wandering (completely normal — gently return to the body)
- Drowsiness (welcome — let it come)

*If you fall asleep during the body scan, that is perfectly fine.
The practice has done its work.*

---

### Phase 3: Deepening ([X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
[Visualization, counting, or guided imagery to deepen relaxation]

**How to do it:**
1. [Specific deepening technique for this practice]
2. [Pacing guidance — voice becoming slower, pauses longer]
3. [Imagery details if applicable]
4. [Permission to drift at any point]

**What you might notice:**
- Hypnagogic imagery (vivid images at sleep threshold — normal)
- Floating sensation or body boundary dissolving (normal)
- Sudden jerks or twitches (hypnic jerks — harmless, normal)
- Time distortion (natural at sleep boundary)

---

### Phase 4: Fading Out ([X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Release into sleep.

**How to do it:**
1. [Final gentle guidance — voice very soft, very slow]
2. Long pauses between phrases (10-15 seconds)
3. "You may drift off whenever you're ready..."
4. Final words, then silence
5. [Auto-shutoff activates — no further sound or light]

*This is the last instruction. Whatever happens now is right.*

---

## Dream Journaling Prompt (Morning After)

**When you wake:**

1. Before moving or checking your phone, lie still for a moment
2. Notice any images, feelings, or fragments from sleep
3. Reach for your journal and write whatever comes — even single words
4. Don't judge or interpret — just capture
5. Date your entry

**Today's prompt:**
> [Specific dream journaling question or open invitation.
> Example: "What images lingered when you woke? What feeling
> accompanied them?"]

*Dream recall improves with practice. If nothing comes, simply
note "No recall today" — that is also valid data.*

---

## Variations

### If sleep doesn't come
- Do not watch the clock (cover or remove visible clocks)
- After 20-30 minutes of wakefulness, get up and do something calm
  in dim light (reading, gentle stretching) until drowsy, then return
- Remember: rest without sleep is still restorative
- Avoid telling yourself "I can't sleep" — reframe as "I'm resting"

### If this feels too long
- Skip the 60-minute pre-routine; start at 15 minutes before bed
- Shorten the body scan to 3-5 minutes
- Use the arrival phase alone as your practice
- Even 5 minutes of intentional wind-down has value

### If you want to deepen
- Add dream journaling in the morning
- Explore dream incubation (setting a question before sleep)
- Extend the body scan with more detailed attention
- Combine with Ayurvedic practices (warm milk, oiling feet)

### Seasonal Adjustments
- **Winter:** Longer wind-down, warmer room (still 60-67°F), heavier
  bedding, earlier start to evening routine
- **Summer:** Cooling practices, lighter coverings, room darkening
  (longer daylight), slightly later routine

## Evidence Box

> **What research suggests:** Sleep hygiene education, relaxation
> training, and stimulus control are well-supported components of
> behavioral sleep medicine. A meta-analysis by Murawski et al. (2018)
> found that multi-component sleep hygiene interventions improved sleep
> quality in non-clinical populations. Body scan meditation has been
> associated with improved sleep quality in several studies (Black et
> al., 2015, JAMA Internal Medicine, n=49). Yoga nidra has shown
> moderate evidence for sleep quality improvement (Moszeik et al.,
> 2020). Dream journaling for emotional processing has preliminary
> evidence (Edwards et al., 2013).
>
> **Limitations:** Most sleep hygiene studies have moderate sample
> sizes. Effects vary significantly by individual. For chronic insomnia,
> full CBT-I protocol is more effective than sleep hygiene alone.
>
> **Traditional context:** Sleep-supportive practices appear across
> traditions: Ayurvedic *dinacharya* (daily routine, including evening
> rituals documented in Charaka Samhita, c. 200 BCE), TCM organ clock
> theory (liver-blood relationship, 1-3 AM liver time), Asclepian
> dream temples (Greek, c. 500 BCE), and Tibetan dream yoga (Six
> Yogas of Naropa, 11th century CE).

*This practice draws from [tradition(s)]. We acknowledge the lineages
that have preserved sleep wisdom across cultures and centuries.*

*This practice supports but does not replace medical care. If you
experience persistent sleep difficulties, consult a sleep medicine
specialist. CBT-I is the recommended first-line treatment for
chronic insomnia.*

## Element Guidelines

### Medical Disclaimer

**Purpose:** Ensure users with sleep disorders seek appropriate care

**Requirements:**
- Persistent insomnia referral to CBT-I (specific and clear)
- Sleep apnea awareness (relaxation doesn't fix airway obstruction)
- Parasomnia awareness (some practices may worsen)
- Medical consultation recommendation

**This section must NEVER be shortened or removed.** Sleep disorders
are common and underdiagnosed. Our role is to support, not delay
appropriate care.

### Environment Preparation

**Purpose:** Optimize the physical sleep environment

**Key principles:**
- Temperature range (60-67°F / 15-19°C) — evidence-based
- Light reduction (melatonin support)
- Sound management (consistent ambient preferred over silence for many)
- Device management (the screen paradox addressed honestly)
- Stimulus control (bed for sleep, not for scrolling)

### Pre-Sleep Routine

**Purpose:** Structure the descent from waking activity to sleep

**Key principles:**
- Progressive dimming (activity level, light, stimulation all decrease)
- Consistent timing (circadian rhythm support)
- Flexible structure (adapt to individual schedules)
- 60-30-15 framework provides scaffolding, not rigid rules

### Body Scan Phase

**Purpose:** Invite physical relaxation

**Key principles:**
- Invitation, not command ("allow" not "make")
- Progressive — move through the whole body
- Permission to fall asleep at any point
- No performance pressure

**Language:**
- "Allow your forehead to soften" not "Relax your forehead"
- "Notice what's here" not "Release all tension"
- "If sleep comes, welcome it" not "Stay awake for the whole scan"

### Fading Out Phase

**Purpose:** Transition from guided practice to sleep

**Key principles:**
- Voice volume and pace decrease progressively
- Pauses grow longer (5s → 10s → 15s → silence)
- Final permission statement
- Auto-shutoff — NO lingering audio or light after practice ends
- The silence itself is part of the practice

### Dream Journaling Prompt

**Purpose:** Support morning dream recall and reflection

**Key principles:**
- Placed as MORNING practice, not bedtime
- Capture before moving or device use
- Fragments are valuable — completeness not required
- No authoritative interpretation
- Open-ended prompts, not leading questions

### Evidence Box

**Purpose:** Honest framing of the research basis

**Required in every protocol:**
- Sleep hygiene evidence level (strong for components)
- CBT-I acknowledgment as gold standard
- Specific study citations with sample sizes
- Tradition attribution with dates
- Honest limitations (individual variation, study quality)
