## Before You Begin

### You'll Need
- [Duration] of uninterrupted time
- A comfortable seated or lying position
- Quiet environment (helpful but not required)
- Optional: timer or the breathwork app

### Preparation
1. Sit or lie in a comfortable position
2. Ensure you won't be disturbed
3. Take 3 natural breaths to settle
4. Relax your shoulders, jaw, and hands

---

## The Practice

### Round 1: [Round Name or Number]

**Phase 1: Power Breaths ([N] breaths)**

**What you'll do:**
Take [N] deep, rhythmic breaths at a steady pace.

**How to do it:**
1. Inhale fully — belly first, then chest (through nose or mouth)
2. Exhale — relaxed release, don't force (through mouth)
3. Maintain a steady rhythm: approximately one breath every [X] seconds
4. [Counting cues: "1... 2... 3..." or "use the timer"]
5. On the last breath, inhale fully, then let the exhale go completely

**What you might notice:**
- Tingling in hands, feet, or face (normal — from CO2 changes)
- Lightheadedness (normal — slow your pace if strong)
- Warmth spreading through your body
- Emotional sensations (also normal)

*If tingling becomes uncomfortable or hands cramp, slow your breathing
pace. This is your body signaling to ease off slightly.*

---

**Phase 2: Retention — "The Hold"**

**What you'll do:**
After the final exhale, hold your breath with lungs mostly empty.

**How to do it:**
1. After your last exhale, simply... don't inhale
2. Relax your body completely — no clenching, no straining
3. Observe the sensations calmly
4. Notice the urge to breathe building gradually
5. Hold until the gasp reflex becomes strong — then proceed to Phase 3

**What you might notice:**
- Calm, still sensation initially
- Growing urge to breathe (this is normal and expected)
- Possible swallowing reflex
- Sense of time distortion
- Some people experience deep calm or vivid imagery

*There is no target time. Hold as long as feels right for YOUR body
today. Some days are longer, some shorter. Both are fine.*

---

**Phase 3: Recovery Breath**

**What you'll do:**
Take one deep recovery breath and hold briefly.

**How to do it:**
1. Inhale deeply — fill your lungs completely
2. Hold at the top for [10-15] seconds
3. [Optional for intermediate+: gentle internal squeeze]
4. Exhale slowly and controlled
5. Take [2-3] normal breaths before the next round

**What you might notice:**
- Rush of sensation or relief
- Warmth flooding through your body
- Sense of deep relaxation
- Head clearing

*This completes one round.*

---

### [Repeat for Rounds 2-N with appropriate variations]

*Note: Retention times often naturally increase with each round.
This is normal. Don't chase longer holds — let them come.*

---

### Closing

**What you'll do:**
Return to normal breathing and ground yourself.

**How to do it:**
1. After your final recovery breath, return to natural breathing
2. Close your eyes (if they aren't already)
3. Sit or lie still for 2-3 minutes
4. Notice how your body feels — scan from head to feet
5. When ready, gently open your eyes
6. **IMPORTANT:** Stand up slowly — you may be lightheaded

**What you might notice:**
- Deep calm or heightened awareness
- Body feeling warm and energized
- Mind feeling clear and focused
- Or: tiredness, emotional sensitivity — all valid

*Take a moment before moving on with your day. Your nervous system
just did significant work — honor that with a gentle transition.*

---

## Variations

### If this feels too intense
- Reduce breath count to [lower number]
- Slow the breathing pace
- Reduce to [fewer] rounds
- Take longer rest between rounds
- Stop at any point — partial practice counts

### If you want to deepen the practice
- Increase breath count to [higher number]
- Add a meditation phase after the final round
- Combine with cold exposure (see cold exposure protocol)
- Practice at the same time each day for consistency

### For limited breathing capacity
- Breathe at whatever depth is comfortable
- Nasal breathing only is fine
- Shorter retention is completely valid
- Focus on the rhythm, not the depth

### For different times of day
- **Morning:** Energizing — full protocol, followed by cold shower
- **Midday:** Reset — 2 rounds only, gentle pace
- **Evening:** Avoid within 2 hours of sleep (can be stimulating)

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Suggestion |
|-------|------------|
| Hands cramping or "claw" shape | Slow your breathing pace significantly. This is tetany from low CO2 — not dangerous but a signal to ease off |
| Feeling anxious during retention | End the hold and breathe normally. Anxiety during breath holds is common at first. Shorten retention until comfortable |
| Can't hold for more than 20 seconds | Completely normal for beginners. Duration increases naturally with practice. No target needed |
| Falling asleep during practice | Try sitting upright instead of lying down. Practice earlier in the day |
| No sensations at all | This is fine. Effects can be subtle or build over sessions. Focus on technique, not sensation |
| Emotional release (crying, laughing) | Normal and healthy. The breathing can release stored tension. Allow it, then return to the practice when ready |
| Headache after practice | Drink water. Ensure you're not straining during retention. If persistent, reduce intensity and consult your healthcare provider |

---

## Building a Practice

**Frequency:** Daily practice is ideal. 3-5 times per week is excellent.
Consistency matters more than intensity.

**Timeline:** Allow 1-2 weeks to feel comfortable with the technique.
Retention times typically increase noticeably within 2-3 weeks of
regular practice.

**Progression:**
- Week 1-2: Focus on rhythm and comfort with [beginner parameters]
- Week 3-4: [Intermediate progression]
- Month 2+: [Advanced progression if applicable]
- Ongoing: Deepen awareness and explore variations

## Background

### About the Wim Hof Method

The Wim Hof Method was developed by Wim Hof (b. 1959), a Dutch athlete
known for his ability to withstand extreme cold. The method combines
three pillars: breathing exercises, cold exposure, and commitment
(meditation/mindset).

The breathing component draws parallels with *Tummo* (Tibetan: གཏུམ་མོ་),
an inner heat meditation practice from Tibetan Buddhist traditions,
particularly the Six Yogas of Naropa (11th century CE). While there are
structural similarities, the WHM is a distinct modern adaptation and
should not be conflated with traditional Tummo practice.

### Key Research

- **Kox et al. (2014)** — "Voluntary activation of the innate immune
  system" (PNAS). Randomized controlled trial, n=24. WHM-trained
  participants showed attenuated immune response to endotoxin injection.
- **Muzik et al. (2018)** — "Brain over body" (NeuroImage). fMRI study
  suggesting WHM activates brain regions associated with self-regulation.
- **Additional studies** on cold exposure, autonomic regulation, and
  stress resilience continue to explore the method's mechanisms.

*Note: While promising, the evidence base is still developing.
Most studies have small sample sizes and are often conducted with
Wim Hof's direct involvement. Independent replication is ongoing.*

---

*This practice is adapted from the Wim Hof Method, with parallels to
Tummo breathing from Tibetan Buddhist traditions (Six Yogas of Naropa,
11th century CE). We acknowledge both the modern developer and the
ancient traditions that inform this work.*

*This practice complements but does not replace medical care.
Consult your healthcare provider before beginning any new health
practice, especially one involving controlled hyperventilation.*
