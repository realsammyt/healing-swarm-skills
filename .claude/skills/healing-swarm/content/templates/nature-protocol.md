  practice

### Physical Accessibility
- This practice can be done [seated/standing/walking — specify]
- [Mobility aid accommodation — specify]
- Indoor alternative provided below for those who cannot go outdoors
- Modify any element to suit your body's needs and limitations

### Stop or Modify If You Experience:
- Heat-related symptoms (dizziness, nausea, confusion)
- Allergic reaction (swelling, difficulty breathing, hives)
- Chest pain or shortness of breath beyond mild exertion
- Significant joint or muscle pain
- Emotional distress (return to a safe, familiar space)
- Any feeling that something is not right — trust your instincts

*Nature practice should feel restorative, not depleting. If it
becomes stressful, return to shelter and rest.*

## Tradition Attribution

[Name the tradition(s) this practice draws from with specificity.
Include dates, key figures, and lineage acknowledgment.]

**Example:**
> This practice is adapted from *shinrin-yoku* (森林浴, "forest
> bathing"), formalized in Japan in 1982 by the Japanese Ministry
> of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries as a national health
> program. Its roots extend deeper into Shinto traditions of sacred
> forest reverence and the understanding of natural spaces as
> spiritually purifying. Modern research, primarily led by Dr. Qing
> Li at Nippon Medical School, has explored physiological mechanisms
> since the early 2000s.
>
> We honor the Japanese tradition that formalized this practice and
> the Shinto heritage that informs its spiritual dimension.

---

## Weather and Safety Considerations

### Season-Specific Guidance

**Spring:**
- Pollen awareness — check levels if allergic
- Ground may be wet/muddy — appropriate footwear
- Changing temperatures — layer clothing
- Observation focus: emergence, new growth, returning birds

**Summer:**
- Heat management: morning or evening practice preferred
- Sun protection mandatory (SPF, hat, shade)
- Hydration essential
- Insect awareness: repellent if needed, tick checks after
- Observation focus: fullness, warmth, long light

**Autumn:**
- Daylight reduction: time practice with available light
- Falling temperatures: warm layers
- Wet leaves can be slippery
- Observation focus: change, release, harvest themes

**Winter:**
- Hypothermia risk with prolonged outdoor exposure
- Shorten outdoor duration; extend indoor/window practice
- Warm clothing, hat, gloves essential
- Ice and snow: assess terrain carefully
- Observation focus: stillness, dormancy, essential forms

---

## The Practice

### Arrival (2-3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Settle into the natural space and transition from "going somewhere" to
"being here."

**How to do it:**
1. [Arrive at the practice location]
2. Stand or sit comfortably. Set down bags, put phone on silent
3. Take 3 slow breaths — exhale fully each time
4. Notice your feet on the ground (or your body in the seat)
5. Silently or aloud: "I'm here. I have nowhere else to be."

*The practice begins when you stop trying to get anywhere.*

---

### Seeing (3-5 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Engage visual attention in a soft, receptive way.

**How to do it:**
1. Let your gaze soften — not focused on any single point
2. Notice what catches your attention without seeking
3. [Specific visual prompts for this practice:
   - "What colors are present?"
   - "What is moving? What is still?"
   - "Let your eyes find something small — a leaf, a pattern"]
4. Spend time with whatever draws you. No need to catalog or analyze

**What you might notice:**
- Peripheral vision becoming more active (attention broadening)
- Colors appearing more vivid after a few minutes
- Micro-movements you wouldn't normally see (insects, leaves, light shifts)

---

### Hearing (3-5 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Open to the layers of sound in the environment.

**How to do it:**
1. Close your eyes if comfortable, or let your gaze rest downward
2. Notice the nearest sound first (your breath, clothing, body)
3. Expand to mid-range sounds (leaves, water, birds, footsteps)
4. Expand to the farthest sound you can detect (traffic, wind, planes)
5. Hold all layers at once — the whole soundscape

**What you might notice:**
- Sounds you didn't initially register becoming audible
- The layered complexity of even "quiet" environments
- Urban sounds and nature sounds coexisting

---

### Smelling (2-3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Engage with the atmospheric scents of the environment.

**How to do it:**
1. Take a slow, deliberate breath through your nose
2. What does the air carry? (Earth, rain, leaves, flowers, soil, distance)
3. [Specific olfactory prompts for this practice:
   - "Crush a leaf gently between your fingers and smell"
   - "Bring your nose close to bark, soil, or a flower"
   - "Simply breathe the air and notice its quality"]
4. Each breath is different — notice the variation

**What you might notice:**
- Subtle scents becoming more apparent with attention
- Emotional or memory associations triggered by smell
- The "freshness" of outdoor air relative to indoor air

---

### Touching (3-5 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Engage physical sensation — the feel of the natural world on your body.

**How to do it:**
1. Notice the air on your exposed skin (face, hands)
2. Feel temperature — warmth, coolness, the contrast of sun and shade
3. [Specific tactile prompts for this practice:
   - "Place your palm on a tree trunk. Feel the texture."
   - "Touch the ground — grass, soil, stone, sand"
   - "Let a leaf or twig rest in your open palm"
   - "Feel the breeze move through your hair or across your arms"]
4. There is no need to name what you feel — just feel it

**What you might notice:**
- Textures richer than expected (bark is a complex landscape)
- Temperature variations across small distances
- A settling or calming sensation from physical contact with nature

---

### Tasting (Optional — 1-2 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
If appropriate and safe, engage the sense of taste.

**How to do it:**
1. [Only include if safe and relevant for this practice:
   - "Sip water or tea mindfully in this setting"
   - "Taste the air — open your mouth slightly and breathe"
   - "If you can identify an edible plant (mint, rosemary in a garden),
     taste a small piece"]
2. SAFETY: Never taste unknown plants, mushrooms, or berries

*This sense is optional. Many nature practices omit taste entirely.
Its inclusion depends on setting and safety.*

---

### Integration (3-5 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Open all senses simultaneously and rest in whole-body nature presence.

**How to do it:**
1. All senses open at once — seeing, hearing, smelling, feeling
2. Don't focus on any single sense. Let attention be panoramic
3. Notice yourself as part of this place — not observer, but participant
4. Breathe naturally. No technique needed
5. If a feeling of gratitude arises, let it be. If not, that's fine too

**What you might notice:**
- A sense of expanding awareness
- Quieting of inner dialogue
- Physical relaxation (shoulders dropping, breath deepening)
- A feeling of "rightness" or belonging (common, not required)
- Simple calm

---

### Closing (2-3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Gently transition back to daily life.

**How to do it:**
1. Take a breath and silently thank this place
2. Notice one thing you want to carry back from this practice
   (a feeling, an image, a sense of quiet)
3. Slowly begin to re-engage with practical awareness
   (time, schedule, next activity)
4. Gather your belongings
5. Leave the space as you found it — or better

*The transition back is part of the practice. Don't rush.*

## Element Guidelines

### Safety Section

**Purpose:** Ensure user safety in outdoor and natural environments

**Requirements:**
- Weather check
- Sun exposure awareness
- Terrain assessment
- Wildlife and plant awareness
- Allergy consideration
- Hydration for longer practices
- Communication plan for extended practices
- Medical disclaimer

**This section is ESSENTIAL for outdoor practices.** Nature environments
present real physical risks (heat, cold, terrain, wildlife, allergens).
Safety framing must be proportional to the setting.

### Sensory Engagement Phases

**Purpose:** Guide structured nature connection through the five senses

**Key principles:**
- One sense at a time, then integration
- Invitational language ("notice" not "look at")
- Inclusive of varied sensory abilities
- Duration flexible — users can spend more or less time in each phase
- Taste is always optional and safety-gated

**Language:**
- "What catches your attention?" not "Look at the nearest tree"
- "What sounds are present?" not "Listen to the birds singing"
- "Feel the air on your skin" not "You should feel calm"

### Urban/Indoor Alternative

**Purpose:** Ensure every practice is accessible regardless of location

**This section is MANDATORY.** No nature practice is published without
a genuine urban or indoor alternative.

**Key principles:**
- Not presented as "lesser" or "second-best"
- Complete practice in its own right
- Uses whatever natural elements are available (sky through window,
  indoor plants, potted herbs, nature sounds)
- Acknowledges environmental privilege honestly

### Seasonal Variations

**Purpose:** Make practices relevant year-round

**Key principles:**
- Every practice includes seasonal guidance
- Winter practices prioritize indoor/window options with brief outdoor
  exposure
- Summer practices include heat safety
- Observation themes shift with seasons
- No season excluded

### Evidence Box

**Purpose:** Honest framing of the research basis

**Required in every protocol:**
- Shinrin-yoku research cited for forest practices (Li 2010, Li et al. 2007)
- Green space research for park practices (Bratman et al., 2019)
- Earthing research noted as preliminary (Oschman et al., 2015)
- Nature sounds research if relevant (Buxton et al., 2021)
- Sample sizes noted
- Limitations acknowledged
- Traditional attribution with dates

### Sensory Accessibility
- Multi-sensory design means practice works even if one sense is limited
- Visual practice instructions have non-visual alternatives
- Hearing-based phases can be adapted to vibration or tactile sensation
- All instructions accessible via screen reader

### Psychological Safety
- Permission to stop at any phase
- No required emotional response
- Nature connection framed as available, not owed
- "Not every nature experience will feel magical — ordinary attention
  is the practice"
- Return-to-shelter instructions if overwhelmed
