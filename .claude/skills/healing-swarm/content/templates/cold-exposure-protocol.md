---

## Overview

[2-3 sentences describing this specific cold exposure level and its
purpose within the progressive WHM cold training. Include evidence level.]

> **Evidence note:** Cold exposure research suggests benefits including
> catecholamine release (norepinephrine, dopamine), brown adipose tissue
> activation, and anti-inflammatory signaling. Most studies use varied
> protocols, making direct comparison difficult. Individual responses
> vary significantly.

## Safety — Read Before Every Session

### Absolute Rules
- For cold immersion (baths, natural water): **ALWAYS have a partner present**
- **NEVER** submerge your head during cold training
- **NEVER** jump or dive into cold water — always enter gradually
- **NEVER** practice full WHM breathing immediately before entering water
  (only 2-3 calm breaths)
- Have warm clothing and towels within arm's reach
- Know the signs of hypothermia

### Contraindications — Do Not Practice If You Have:
- Cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension
- History of heart attack, stroke, or TIA
- Raynaud's phenomenon or cold urticaria
- Pregnancy
- Epilepsy or seizure disorders
- Open wounds or recent surgery
- Uncontrolled diabetes (peripheral neuropathy)
- Cold agglutinin disease
- Any condition your healthcare provider has advised against cold stress

### Exit Immediately If You Experience:
- Chest pain or pressure
- Severe headache
- Confusion or difficulty thinking clearly
- Uncontrollable shivering that won't stop after rewarming
- Blue lips, fingers, or toes
- Inability to move extremities
- Extreme fatigue or desire to sleep while in cold
- Any feeling that something is wrong — trust your instincts

*If you have any medical conditions, consult your healthcare provider
before beginning cold exposure training.*

## Before You Begin

### Environment Setup
- [Specific setup for this protocol level]
- Non-slip surface (mat in shower/tub)
- Warm towel within arm's reach
- Timer visible or audible
- [For immersion: warm space accessible within 30 seconds]
- [For immersion: partner briefed on safety protocol]

### Pre-Exposure Preparation
1. [Pre-exposure breathing — 2-3 calm breaths, NOT full WHM protocol]
2. [Mental preparation — acknowledge this will be uncomfortable]
3. [Physical check — how do you feel right now?]
4. [Environment check — towel ready, timer set, partner aware]

---

## The Practice

### Step 1: [Entry/Transition]

**What you'll do:**
[How to enter the cold exposure]

**How to do it:**
1. [Specific entry instruction]
2. [Breathing instruction during initial shock]
3. [Body positioning]
4. [Pacing guidance]

**What you might notice:**
- The gasp reflex — a sharp involuntary inhale (normal)
- Rapid heart rate increase (normal)
- Skin feeling "on fire" briefly (normal cold shock response)
- Strong desire to escape (normal — breathe through it)

*Duration: [X seconds/minutes]*

---

### Step 2: [Sustained Exposure]

**What you'll do:**
[How to maintain the cold exposure]

**How to do it:**
1. [Breathing technique during exposure]
2. [Body awareness cues]
3. [Mental focus guidance]
4. [Duration target for this level]

**What you might notice:**
- Initial shock subsiding after 30-60 seconds
- Breathing becoming more controlled
- Skin numbness in exposed areas
- Possible shivering (healthy warming response)

*Duration: [X seconds/minutes]*

---

### Step 3: [Exit and Rewarm]

**What you'll do:**
[How to safely exit and rewarm]

**How to do it:**
1. [Exit instruction — gradual, not panicked]
2. [Immediate post-exposure — towel, clothing]
3. [Active rewarming — movement, warm layers]
4. [Observation period — 10-15 minutes]
5. [Warm beverage (optional)]

**What you might notice:**
- "Afterdrop" — feeling colder 5-10 minutes AFTER exiting (normal)
- Skin reddening (increased blood flow — healthy)
- Feeling of euphoria or energy (catecholamine release)
- Intense shivering (the body generating heat — healthy)

*IMPORTANT: Continue monitoring for 15-20 minutes after exposure.
Afterdrop can cause continued cooling even after you exit the cold.*

## Variations

### If this feels too intense
- [Reduce duration]
- [Increase water temperature slightly]
- [Expose only extremities first]
- [Take a break and return to previous level]

### If you want to progress
- [Criteria for moving to next level]
- [How to increase duration/decrease temperature]
- [When to introduce the next protocol level]

### For different environments
- [Home shower adaptation]
- [Outdoor/natural water considerations]
- [Seasonal adjustments]

### For different times of day
- **Morning:** Most popular — energizing start to the day
- **Post-workout:** May support recovery (evidence mixed)
- **Evening:** Some find it stimulating; experiment carefully

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Suggestion |
|-------|------------|
| Can't stop gasping | This is the cold shock response — it fades with practice. Start warmer, not colder. Focus on slow exhale |
| Hands/feet go numb quickly | Normal in cold water. If it persists after rewarming, reduce exposure time |
| Shivering won't stop | Get warm immediately — warm clothing, warm room, warm (not hot) drink. Extended uncontrollable shivering is a warning sign |
| Skin stays blotchy for hours | Mild blotchiness is normal. If severe or persistent, reduce exposure intensity and consult a healthcare provider |
| Can't make myself do it | Start smaller. Even 5 seconds of cold is practice. Consistency builds tolerance. Never force through genuine distress |
| Feel worse, not better | Reduce intensity. Not every day is a good day for cold exposure. Illness, poor sleep, and high stress all affect tolerance |

## Building a Practice

**Frequency:** [Recommended schedule for this level]

**Timeline:** [How long to practice at this level before progressing]

**Progression Criteria:**
Move to the next level when:
- [ ] Current exposure feels challenging but manageable
- [ ] Breathing stays controlled throughout
- [ ] No adverse symptoms during or after
- [ ] Consistent practice for at least [X] weeks at this level
- [ ] [Level-specific criteria]

*This practice is part of the Wim Hof Method cold exposure pillar.
Cold water therapy has roots in many traditions, including Nordic cold
bathing (Scandinavian traditions, centuries-old), Russian *banya* and
ice swimming, Japanese *Misogi* (禊) water purification, and Kneipp
hydrotherapy (Sebastian Kneipp, 19th century Germany). The WHM
represents a modern systematization of progressive cold adaptation.*

*This practice complements but does not replace medical care.
Cold exposure is a significant cardiovascular stressor. Consult your
healthcare provider before beginning, especially if you have any
heart, circulatory, or respiratory conditions.*

## Element Guidelines

### Safety Section

**Purpose:** Ensure user safety before every session

**This section must NEVER be shortened or softened.** Cold exposure
carries real cardiovascular risk. The safety section is the most
important part of every protocol.

**Partner requirement:**
- Levels 1-2 (shower): Recommended for beginners, optional for experienced
- Levels 3-4 (immersion): MANDATORY — non-negotiable

### Entry Phase

**Purpose:** Guide the transition into cold

**Key principles:**
- Gradual entry (never jumping in)
- Breathing guidance for the gasp reflex
- Normalize the shock response
- Permission to exit at any time

**Language:**
- "Enter gradually" not "Get in quickly to get it over with"
- "Breathe through the initial shock" not "Ignore the discomfort"
- "You can always step out" not "Commit to the full time"

### Sustained Exposure

**Purpose:** Guide the maintained cold contact

**Key principles:**
- Breathing is the primary tool
- Duration is secondary to safety
- Observe, don't fight
- No target endurance

**Language:**
- "Notice your breathing settling" not "Control your breathing"
- "Stay as long as feels right" not "Push for one more minute"
- "Your body is adapting" not "Pain is weakness leaving the body"

### Rewarming Phase

**Purpose:** Safely return to normal temperature

**Key principles:**
- Afterdrop warning (continued cooling after exit)
- Active rewarming protocol
- Observation period (15-20 minutes)
- No hot water immediately (temperature shock risk)

## Temperature Reference

| Description | Celsius | Fahrenheit |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| Cool (comfortable) | 20-25°C | 68-77°F |
| Cold (challenging) | 15-20°C | 59-68°F |
| Very cold (intense) | 10-15°C | 50-59°F |
| Ice cold (advanced) | 5-10°C | 41-50°F |
| Near freezing (expert) | 0-5°C | 32-41°F |

**Important:** Water temperature affects exposure duration dramatically.
5 minutes at 15°C is very different from 5 minutes at 5°C. Always
account for water temperature when setting duration.
