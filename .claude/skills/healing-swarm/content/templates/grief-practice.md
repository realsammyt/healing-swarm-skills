## Important Notice

*This practice is offered as a contemplative companion for grief. It does
NOT replace professional grief counseling, therapy, or medical care.*

*If grief feels overwhelming, if you are unable to function in daily life,
or if grief is intensifying rather than shifting over time, please consider
reaching out to a grief-specialized therapist. Seeking help is not a sign
of weakness — it is an act of courage.*

*Continue all prescribed treatments unless your healthcare provider advises
otherwise.*

## Overview

[2-3 sentences describing this specific practice. What it offers. What it
does NOT promise. Gentle, spacious tone.]

> **A note about grief:** Grief is not a disorder to be fixed. It is the
> natural response to loss — a reflection of what mattered. This practice
> does not aim to take your grief away. It offers a space to be with
> whatever is here, for as long as feels right.

> **Evidence note:** [Appropriate evidence statement using the evidence

## Before You Begin

### Emotional Safety Preparation

1. **Choose a time** when you have no pressing obligations afterward
2. **Choose a space** where you feel safe and will not be interrupted
3. **Let someone know** (optional): If it feels right, let a trusted
   person know you are doing a grief practice. You do not need to
   explain more than that
4. **Gather comfort objects** (optional): A blanket, a photo, an object
   that connects you to what you have lost, a cup of tea
5. **Know your exit**: You may stop this practice at any time. Stopping
   is not failure — it is listening to what you need

### Grounding Before You Begin

Before entering the practice, ground yourself:
1. Feel your feet on the ground — press gently
2. Place one hand on your chest, one on your belly
3. Breathe naturally — do not try to change your breath
4. Name three things you can see in the room
5. Say your own name aloud, gently
6. If you have a comfort object, hold it now

*Take as long as you need. There is no rush.*

---

## The Practice

### Opening ([X] minutes)

[Gentle entry. Settle into the space. Acknowledge what brings the
person here. No pressure to feel anything specific.]

"[Opening script — spacious, permissive, unhurried]"

---

### EXIT RAMP #1

*If being here is enough for today — if simply showing up and sitting
down is all you have — that is complete. You may skip to the Closing
section at any time. This counts. You count.*

---

### Core Practice ([X] minutes)

[The heart of the grief practice. Detailed, step-by-step guidance
with generous space between instructions. Process-oriented, not
outcome-oriented.]

"[Core practice script — contemplative, spacious, holding]"

[Include silence periods marked explicitly]

---

### EXIT RAMP #2

*Pause here if you need to. Place your hand on your heart. Breathe.
You do not have to continue. Whatever you have done so far is enough.
If you would like, move to the Closing section.*

---

### Deepening (optional) ([X] minutes)

[For those who wish to stay longer. Never required. Additional
guidance that goes deeper into the grief engagement.]

"[Deepening script — only for those who choose to continue]"

---

### EXIT RAMP #3

*At any point, you may open your eyes, place both hands on your
thighs, and feel their weight. You may move to the Closing whenever
you are ready. There is no wrong time to stop.*

---

## What You Might Experience

**All of these are valid grief responses — there is no wrong way
to grieve:**

- **Tears** — grief finding its way out through the body
- **Anger** — a fierce response to what should not have happened
- **Numbness** — the mind's way of protecting you when feeling is
  too much
- **Relief** — sometimes present alongside grief, and that is not
  betrayal
- **Guilt** — "I should have..." is grief's most common companion
- **Laughter** — memory sometimes brings joy; that is not disrespect
- **Nothing** — sometimes grief is quiet. That does not mean it is
  absent
- **Physical sensations** — heaviness, tightness, hollowness, aching
- **Confusion** — not knowing what to feel is itself a feeling

*Whatever you are experiencing right now is exactly right.*

---

## Closing and Grounding

[Extended grounding sequence — longer and more thorough than any
other practice type]

**What you'll do:**
Return slowly and gently to the present moment.

**How to do it:**
1. If your eyes are closed, keep them closed for a moment longer
2. Place both hands on your body — wherever feels comforting
3. Feel your breath moving. Do not change it
4. Notice the surface beneath you — its texture, its support
5. Slowly open your eyes. Look at something nearby
6. Name what you see — silently or aloud
7. Feel your feet on the ground
8. Say to yourself, gently: "I am here. I showed up for my grief.
   That takes courage."
9. Take your time before standing or moving

*There is no rush to return to ordinary activity. If you can, sit
quietly for a few minutes after. Drink water. Be gentle with yourself.*

---

## Journal Reflection (Optional — Never Required)

*Writing can sometimes help grief find words. But it does not have to.
If you would like, consider one of these prompts. If not, simply rest.*

- What is present for you right now?
- If your grief could speak, what would it say?
- What do you want to remember about what you have lost?
- What kindness could you offer yourself today?

*You do not have to share this with anyone. It is yours.*

## When to Seek Professional Support

**Consider reaching out to a grief-specialized therapist if:**

- Grief is intensifying rather than shifting after 12+ months
- You are unable to function in daily life (work, self-care, relationships)
- You are having persistent thoughts of self-harm or suicide
- You are unable to accept the reality of the loss after extended time
- You have completely withdrawn from all relationships
- Substance use is increasing in response to grief
- You feel "stuck" in a way that frightens you

**This is not a sign of weakness. Grief can sometimes need more
support than any practice can offer, and a skilled professional
can provide that support.**

## Variations

### If this feels too intense
- Shorten the practice to just the Opening and Closing
- Keep your eyes open throughout
- Hold a comfort object the entire time
- Do the practice with a trusted person nearby
- Practice grounding only — that is enough

### For grief over health or ability loss
- Adapt body-awareness sections for current physical experience
- Acknowledge that the body you are in now is worthy of compassion
- Name the specific loss if it feels right
- Include gratitude for what the body can still do (without minimizing loss)

### For recent loss (first weeks)
- Shorten everything
- More grounding, less engagement
- Simply being present is the entire practice
- Extra exit ramps — assume the person may need to stop at any moment

### For anniversary or milestone grief
- Include a small ritual element (lighting a candle, placing a photo)
- Acknowledge the significance of the date
- Holding continuity with the person/thing lost

---

## Building a Practice

**Frequency:** There is no required frequency. Practice when grief
calls you to it. Daily, weekly, monthly, or on significant dates.

**Progression:**
- Begin with Acknowledgment practices as long as needed
- When sitting with grief feels possible (not comfortable — possible),
  explore Sitting With Grief practices
- Ritual practices may feel right at any time — follow your instinct
- Meaning-making comes when it comes. Do not rush toward it
- Integration is not a destination. It is an ongoing practice of
  carrying loss with tenderness

**Remember:** Grief is not linear. You may move forward and then
circle back. That is not regression — it is the natural shape of grief.

## Background

### About Grief-Informed Practices

Grief practices draw from thousands of years of human mourning tradition.
Every culture in recorded history has developed rituals, practices, and
frameworks for processing loss — because grief is one of the most
universal human experiences.

Contemporary grief research has moved away from "stage" models (Kubler-Ross,
1969) toward more nuanced understandings: the Dual Process Model (Stroebe &
Schut, 1999), which recognizes oscillation between grief and restoration;
Continuing Bonds theory (Klass, Silverman & Nickman, 1996), which validates
ongoing relationship with the lost; and meaning-making frameworks (Neimeyer,
2001) that support narrative integration of loss.

### Key Research

- **Klass, Silverman & Nickman (1996)** — *Continuing Bonds: New
  Understandings of Grief*. Challenged the "letting go" model; established
  that maintaining bonds with the deceased is healthy and normal.
- **Stroebe & Schut (1999)** — Dual Process Model of Coping with
  Bereavement. Oscillation between loss-oriented and restoration-oriented
  coping.
- **Shear et al. (2005, 2014)** — Complicated grief treatment.
  Demonstrated effectiveness of targeted therapy for prolonged grief.
- **Thieleman & Cacciatore (2014)** — Mindfulness-based grief interventions.
  Moderate evidence for reducing grief symptoms.
- **Neimeyer (2001)** — *Meaning Reconstruction and the Experience of Loss*.
  Narrative approaches to grief integration.

*Note: Grief research is well-established but complex. Individual responses
to grief vary enormously. No single practice works for everyone, and that
is expected.*

---

*This practice honors the mourning traditions of many cultures and the
contemporary grief research that helps us understand the human experience
of loss. We acknowledge the lineages that have held space for grief
across millennia.*

*This practice is offered as a contemplative companion. It does not
replace professional grief counseling or medical care. If you are
struggling, please reach out to a qualified professional.*
