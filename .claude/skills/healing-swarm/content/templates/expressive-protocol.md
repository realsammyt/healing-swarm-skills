*[Attribution statement honoring tradition holders]*

---

## Materials and Space Preparation

### Materials
- [List specific materials needed — keep accessible and simple]
- [Note: "If you don't have [X], [Y] works just as well"]
- [No expensive or specialized equipment required]

### Space
- [Quiet, private space where you won't be interrupted]
- [Surface for working (table, floor, lap)]
- [Optional: music, candle, natural light]

### Emotional Safety Setup
1. Read through the full practice before beginning
2. Have grounding techniques ready (see Grounding section below)
3. Know that you may stop at any time
4. Remind yourself: this is for you alone — no one will see or
   judge what you create unless you choose to share it

---

## Grounding

**Use this at any point if emotions feel overwhelming:**

1. Put down your pen/brush/materials
2. Place both feet flat on the ground
3. Press your palms flat on the surface in front of you
4. Take three slow breaths — in through the nose, out through
   the mouth
5. Name three things you can see in the room
6. Say your own name aloud, gently
7. When you feel settled, you may continue or stop — either is right

---

## The Practice

### Warm-Up / Loosening ([X] minutes)

**Purpose:** Quiet the inner critic and loosen the creative muscles.

[A low-stakes, playful creative exercise. This is essential for
bypassing the "I'm not creative" or "I can't do this" resistance.]

"[Warm-up script — light, invitational, low pressure]"

**What you might notice:**
- Resistance or awkwardness — this is normal and expected
- A feeling of playfulness — welcome it
- Nothing in particular — also fine

---

### Core Creative Practice ([X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
[Brief overview of the core creative practice]

**Emotional safety framing:**
"What emerges is yours alone. There is no wrong way to create.
If something surprising or intense comes up, that is the creative
process doing its work. You may pause at any time and return to
the grounding exercise."

**Step-by-step guidance:**

1. [First instruction — clear, process-oriented]
2. [Second instruction — building on the first]
3. [Continue with gentle pacing]
4. [Include silence/space markers for timed practices]

[Process-oriented cues throughout:]
- "Notice what wants to emerge — you don't have to direct it"
- "If the inner critic speaks up, thank it and keep going"
- "The mess is part of it — don't edit, don't fix, just continue"
- "Follow what interests you, not what you think you 'should' do"

---

### EXIT RAMP

*If this is enough for today, you may move to the Closing section.
Whatever you have created — even a single line, a single mark —
is enough. The practice is in the doing, not the finishing.*

---

### Reflection / Integration (optional, [X] minutes)

[Optional reflection on the creative process — not on the quality
of what was created.]

**If you'd like to reflect, consider:**
- What surprised you about the process?
- What did your hands/pen/voice want to do?
- Is there an emotion or sensation present now that wasn't before?
- What would you title what you made, if you had to?

**Remember:** Reflection is optional. Sometimes the practice itself
is complete without words.

**Sharing:** If you have a trusted person you'd like to share with,
you may — but this is never required. What you created is yours.

---

## Closing and Grounding

1. Put down your materials
2. Look at what you've created — without judgment, just observation
   (or: close the journal, set it aside)
3. Take three natural breaths
4. Place a hand on your chest
5. Say to yourself: "I showed up. I let something emerge. That
   is enough."
6. Stand slowly if you've been sitting for a while
7. Drink water. Stretch gently if you'd like

---

## Privacy Notice

**What you create in this practice belongs entirely to you.**

- You are not required to show it to anyone
- You may keep it, hide it, or destroy it — all valid choices
- No one will evaluate, analyze, or grade your creative expression
- If this is digital writing, it should be stored locally and
  never transmitted without your explicit consent
- You own what you create, fully and completely

---

## Evidence

> **What research suggests:** [Evidence statement with appropriate
> qualification from the evidence language scale]
>
> **Source:** [Author, Year, Journal, PMID/DOI]
>
> **Note:** [Limitations, sample size, caveats]
>
> **Important:** [Note if temporary distress increase is expected —
> Pennebaker research shows short-term distress increase before
> improvement. Include this honestly.]

---

## Variations

### If the inner critic is loud
- Start with the warm-up only — that is a complete practice
- Use your non-dominant hand (bypasses perfectionism)
- Set a timer for 3 minutes — "just do it for 3 minutes"
- Crumple, tear, or scribble over what you make — the product
  doesn't matter

### If strong emotions arise
- Pause and use the grounding exercise
- Switch to a simpler, more mechanical creative task (coloring,
  repetitive mark-making)
- Write "I am here, I am safe" as many times as needed
- Stop the practice and return to it another day

### For limited physical ability
- Voice recording instead of writing
- Digital tools instead of physical materials
- Adapt to whatever movement is available
- A single word or mark is a complete creative act

### For different times of day
- **Morning:** Generative, forward-looking prompts
- **Midday:** Short, restorative creative breaks
- **Evening:** Reflective, processing-oriented practices
```

## Element Guidelines

### Emotional Safety Framing

**Purpose:** Ensure creative expression does not overwhelm

**Requirements:**
- Opening safety framing before any creative activity
- "What emerges is yours alone" — stated explicitly
- "No artistic skill required" — stated explicitly
- Grounding exercise available at all times
- At least one exit ramp during the practice
- Privacy commitment stated

**This framing must NEVER be shortened or made optional.**

### Warm-Up / Loosening Exercise

**Purpose:** Lower the stakes and bypass inner critic resistance

**Requirements:**
- Low-stakes, playful activity
- No creative skill required
- Short (3-5 minutes)
- Explicitly framed as non-serious ("This is just to loosen up")
- Examples: scribbling with eyes closed, writing the alphabet
  backward, drawing circles for 60 seconds, writing one word
  per breath

**Key principle:** The warm-up teaches the nervous system that
this space is safe for imperfection.

### Core Creative Practice

**Purpose:** Guide the creative expression process

**Requirements:**
- Process-oriented instructions ("Notice what emerges" not "Create X")
- Step-by-step guidance with generous spacing
- Silence/space markers for timed practices
- Inner critic management cues throughout
- One exit ramp during the core practice
- No evaluation language

**Language:**
- "Let the pen move" not "Write beautifully"
- "Follow what interests you" not "Make something meaningful"
- "The mess is part of it" not "Try to be clearer"

### Reflection / Integration

**Purpose:** Optional processing of the creative experience

**Requirements:**
- ALWAYS optional — stated explicitly
- Focus on PROCESS, not product ("What surprised you?" not "Is it good?")
- Body-based reflection included ("Is there an emotion present now?")
- Sharing framed as optional with trusted person only
- No pressure for insight or revelation

### Privacy Notice

**Purpose:** Protect deeply personal creative content

**Requirements:**
- Explicit statement of ownership ("This belongs to you")
- Right to destroy stated
- No sharing required
- No evaluation by anyone
- Digital privacy addressed (local storage, no transmission)
- Strongest privacy protections in the system

### Evidence Notes

**Purpose:** Honest framing of the research basis

**Required in every protocol:**
- Modality-specific evidence cited (Pennebaker for writing, etc.)
- Sample sizes and limitations noted
- "Suggests" not "proves" language
- Temporary distress increase noted for writing practices
- Individual variation explicitly acknowledged

---

## Accessibility Guidelines

### Physical Accessibility
- Materials kept simple and accessible
- Alternatives for limited mobility (voice recording, digital tools)
- "A single word or mark is a complete creative act"
- No fine motor skill requirements

### Cognitive Accessibility

- Does not rely on any single modality
- Described sensations for self-guidance
- Adaptable to any sensory capacity

### Psychological Safety
- Inner critic management built in
- No evaluation or judgment
