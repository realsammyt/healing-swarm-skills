# [Practice Name]: Resonance Pairing

**Inspired by:** The transferred potential research of Dr. Jacobo
Grinberg-Zylberbaum (UNAM, 1970s–1994)
**Duration:** [X minutes]
**Participants:** [Number and arrangement]
**Difficulty:** [First Time / Experienced / Advanced]
**Facilitator:** [Required / Optional]

## Overview

[2-3 sentences describing the practice and its basis in Grinberg's
transferred potential research. State the ~25% response rate honestly.
Note this is exploratory, not a validated protocol.]

> **Evidence note:** In Grinberg's laboratory, separated meditation
> partners showed correlated brain activity approximately 25% of the
> time (across 50+ experiments). This finding has had limited
> independent replication. These practices are offered as shared
> contemplative exploration, not as evidence of telepathy or
> paranormal connection.

## Before You Begin

### Preparation
- [Space requirements — separate rooms if separation phase included]
- [Seating arrangement]
- [Time required]

### Facilitator Checklist (if applicable)
- [ ] All participants have consented
- [ ] Non-verbal stop/pause signals established
- [ ] Separate spaces available (if separation phase)
- [ ] Grounding techniques reviewed with participants
- [ ] Timer/bell ready

### Cautions
- [Contraindications]
- Not recommended for people who are currently in conflict with each other
- Participants should have basic meditation experience
- If either participant has a trauma history involving interpersonal
  boundary violation, extra care is needed

---

## The Practice

### Phase 1: Individual Preparation ([X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Each participant practices coherence meditation separately.

**How to do it:**
1. [Separate into individual spaces if possible]
2. [Each person follows settling and body awareness practice]
3. [Build stable individual awareness before coming together]

**Purpose:** Establish personal groundedness before shared practice.

*Duration: [X] minutes per person*

---

### Phase 2: Connection Establishment ([X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Come together and establish shared presence.

**How to do it:**
1. [Sit facing each other at comfortable distance]
2. [Choose: gentle eye contact, closed eyes, or soft gaze]
3. [Synchronize breathing naturally (don't force it)]
4. [Notice the presence of the other person without analyzing]

**Consent check:** Both participants confirm they are comfortable
before continuing.

**What you might notice:**
[A sense of settling. Awareness of another presence. Or nothing
particular. Both are normal.]

*Duration: [X] minutes*

---

### Phase 3: Shared Meditation ([X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Practice coherence meditation together in synchronized silence.

**How to do it:**
1. [Close eyes (or soft gaze)]
2. [Follow the 6-phase coherence practice together]
3. [Minimal verbal guidance — a bell marks phase transitions]
4. [Simply practice in proximity, without trying to "connect"]

**What you might notice:**
[A deepening of meditation. Awareness of shared rhythm. Or your
own practice may feel exactly as it does alone. Both are valid.]

*Duration: [X] minutes*

---

### Phase 4: Separation Practice ([X] minutes) — OPTIONAL

**What you'll do:**
Partners separate to different rooms while maintaining practice.

**How to do it:**
1. [At the bell, one partner moves to a separate room]
2. [Both continue meditation practice in their own space]
3. [Maintain practice without trying to "send" or "receive"]
4. [Simply practice and notice what arises]

**Consent note:** This phase is always optional. Either participant
may decline without explanation.

**What you might notice:**
[Your own meditation continuing. Perhaps a sense of the other
person, perhaps not. In Grinberg's research, correlated brain
activity was observed ~25% of the time. Most people notice
nothing unusual — this is the expected, normal experience.]

*Duration: [X] minutes*

---

### Phase 5: Reunification and Sharing ([X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Come back together. Share only what you choose to share.

**How to do it:**
1. [At the bell, come back to shared space]
2. [Sit together for a moment in silence]
3. [Optional sharing — each person may share, or not]
4. [If sharing: describe your own experience only, not the other's]
5. [Grounding practice together]

**Sharing guidelines:**
- Share YOUR experience, not interpretations of the other person's
- "I noticed..." language, not "I felt you..."
- "I'd rather not share right now" is always honored
- No evaluating whose experience was "better" or "more connected"

*Duration: [X] minutes*

---

## Completing the Practice

1. [Brief grounding exercise together]
2. [Express appreciation (optional)]
3. [Take a few minutes individually before re-engaging with the day]

---

## Variations

### For first-time pairs
[Shorter practice, no separation phase, more guidance]

### For experienced pairs
[Standard protocol with separation phase]

### For small groups
[Circle arrangement, synchronized practice, facilitator-led]

### For remote/distance pairs
[Synchronized timing via phone/app, same practice in different locations]

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Suggestion |
|-------|------------|
| Feel self-conscious about eye contact | Soft gaze or closed eyes are both fine. Choose what's comfortable |
| One person wants to share, the other doesn't | Respect the non-sharer. Sharing is always optional |
| Didn't feel any "connection" | This is the most common experience and is completely normal. The practice has value as shared meditation regardless |
| Felt too intense | Open eyes, use grounding, take space. Either person can pause at any time |
| Power dynamic feels unequal | If one person is more experienced or holds authority, use extra care. Consider whether this pairing is appropriate |

## Facilitator Notes

### Pre-Session
- Verify consent from ALL participants
- Establish non-verbal signals (raise hand = pause, stand up = stop)
- Review grounding techniques
- Set timer for all phases
- Prepare separate spaces if separation phase included

### During Session
- Monitor for signs of distress
- Respect silence — don't fill it
- Ring bells clearly at phase transitions
- Be available but not intrusive

### Post-Session
- Facilitate sharing with clear guidelines
- Normalize ALL experiences including "nothing happened"
- Offer grounding if anyone seems unsettled
- Do NOT interpret participants' experiences for them
- Check in individually if anyone seemed distressed

---

*This practice is inspired by the transferred potential research of
Dr. Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum (1946–1994), a neurophysiologist at UNAM.
His finding of correlated brain activity between separated meditation
partners (~25% response rate) is classified as preliminary with limited
independent replication. This practice is offered as shared contemplative
exploration, not as evidence of telepathy or paranormal connection.*

*This practice does not replace medical or psychological care.*

## Element Guidelines

### Consent Section

**Purpose:** Ensure informed, voluntary participation

MUST include a consent framework.

**Requirements:**
- Clear description of what will happen
- Clear statement of what will NOT happen
- Enumerated participant rights

**Required elements:**
- ~25% response rate stated
- 50+ experiments noted
- Limited independent replication acknowledged

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Correlated brain activity was observed ~25% of the time" | "You will feel your partner's thoughts" |
| "Most people notice nothing unusual" | "You should feel a connection" |
| "Both connection and no-connection are normal" | "If you don't feel it, try harder" |
| "Shared contemplative exploration" | "Telepathic meditation" |
