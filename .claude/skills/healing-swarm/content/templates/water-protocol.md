## Medical Disclaimer — READ CAREFULLY

**DROWNING WARNING:** Never practice water immersion alone. A partner
or spotter must be present for any practice involving water deep enough
to cover your face.

**CARDIAC WARNING:** Extreme temperature water (very hot or very cold)
is a significant cardiovascular stressor. If you have ANY heart
condition, blood pressure issues, or history of cardiac events, consult
your cardiologist before beginning water-based practices.

*This practice supports your wellbeing through therapeutic water
contact. It does not replace medical care. Consult your healthcare
provider before beginning, especially if you have cardiac, circulatory,
or respiratory conditions.*

## Tradition Attribution

[Name the tradition(s) this practice draws from with specificity.
Include dates, key figures, and lineage acknowledgment.]

**For contrast therapy practices:**
> This practice draws from the Kneipp method of hydrotherapy, developed
> by Sebastian Kneipp (1821-1897), a Bavarian priest who systematized
> water-based therapeutic practices as one of five pillars of natural
> healing. The Kneipp method was formalized at the Kneipp-Kurhaus in
> Bad Wörishofen, Germany, and has influenced European naturopathy
> for over 150 years. We acknowledge Kneipp as a key figure in making
> hydrotherapy accessible and systematic.

**For ritual bathing education:**
> This section references [tradition] for educational context.
> [Tradition]'s water practices hold deep spiritual significance for
> practitioners and are governed by specific requirements and
> authorities within that tradition. We honor this tradition by
> learning about its significance, not by instructing in its practice.
> Those interested in practicing [ritual] should consult
> [appropriate authority].

## Environment and Equipment

### Setup
- [Specific setup for this practice type]
- **Non-slip surface** (mat in shower or tub — essential)
- **Thermometer** (recommended for precise temperature)
- **Timer** (visible or audible)
- **Warm towels** within arm's reach
- **Warm clothing** staged nearby
- [For immersion: partner present and briefed on safety]
- [For immersion: exit route clear and accessible]

### Temperature Preparation
- Warm water: [specific range for this practice]°F / °C
- Cool water: [specific range for this practice]°F / °C
- **Test with hand or thermometer before entering**
- Adjust if needed — temperature guidelines are ranges, not mandates

---

## The Practice

### Step 1: Preparation and Safety Check (2-3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Prepare the environment and confirm safety.

**How to do it:**
1. Set up the practice space (non-slip mat, towels, timer)
2. Test water temperature
3. [If partner practice: brief partner on safety protocol and exit plan]
4. Take 2-3 calm breaths (NOT full WHM breathing before water)
5. Check in with your body: how do you feel right now?
6. Confirm: "I know how to exit. My towel is ready. I can stop anytime."

---

### Step 2: [Warm Phase / Entry] (X minutes)

**What you'll do:**
[How to enter the warm water phase]

**How to do it:**
1. [Specific entry instruction — gradual, not abrupt]
2. [Body positioning]
3. [Breathing during warm phase]
4. [Duration guidance]
5. [What to notice: relaxation, warmth spreading, tension releasing]

**What you might notice:**
- Skin flushing (vasodilation — blood vessels widening — normal)
- Muscle relaxation
- Heart rate may increase slightly in warm water
- Sense of calm or comfort

**Temperature:** [X°F / Y°C]
**Duration:** [X minutes]

---

### Step 3: [Cool Phase / Transition] (X seconds/minutes)

**What you'll do:**
[How to transition to cool water]

**How to do it:**
1. [Specific transition instruction — gradual when possible]
2. [Breathing guidance during the temperature shift]
3. [Body positioning — which parts first]
4. [Duration guidance]
5. [Permission to shorten or skip if too intense]

**What you might notice:**
- Initial gasp or sharp inhale (cold shock response — normal, brief)
- Skin tingling
- Heart rate change
- Energized sensation after the initial shock passes
- The contrast making the cool feel more intense than it is

**Temperature:** [X°F / Y°C]
**Duration:** [X seconds/minutes]

*If this feels too intense, reduce the temperature contrast (warmer
cool water) or shorten the cool phase. You can always step back.*

---

### Step 4: [Repeat / Additional Cycles] (if contrast protocol)

**Cycle structure:**
1. Return to warm: [X minutes]
2. Cool phase: [X seconds/minutes]
3. [Repeat for N total cycles]
4. Traditionally end on cool (Kneipp method) — but ending on warm
   is also acceptable, especially for beginners

---

### Step 5: Exit and Recovery (3-5 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Safely exit the water and warm/dry yourself.

**How to do it:**
1. **Stand up SLOWLY** — warm water causes vasodilation, and
   orthostatic hypotension (dizziness when standing) is common
2. Steady yourself before stepping out
3. Towel dry thoroughly
4. Put on warm, dry clothing
5. Drink water (rehydrate)
6. Sit quietly for 5 minutes — let your body re-equilibrate
7. Notice how you feel compared to before the practice

**What you might notice:**
- Energized or relaxed (both are normal responses)
- Skin may be flushed or pink (increased circulation — healthy)
- Sense of well-being or clarity
- Mild fatigue (normal after warm immersion)
- Continued temperature regulation for 15-20 minutes after

*IMPORTANT: Monitor for 15-20 minutes after any temperature-contrast
practice. Delayed responses (dizziness, excessive fatigue) should be
addressed by sitting or lying down and warming up.*

## Physiological Response Guide

### What Happens in Warm Water
- **Vasodilation:** Blood vessels widen, increasing circulation
- **Heart rate:** Increases to compensate for vasodilation
- **Blood pressure:** May decrease temporarily
- **Muscle tension:** Decreases (buoyancy and heat)
- **Parasympathetic activation:** Relaxation response
- **Core temperature:** Gradually increases with prolonged immersion

### What Happens in Cool Water
- **Vasoconstriction:** Blood vessels narrow, directing blood to core
- **Heart rate:** Increases briefly (cold shock), then normalizes
- **Blood pressure:** Increases (vasoconstriction)
- **Catecholamine release:** Norepinephrine, dopamine (alertness)
- **Sympathetic activation:** Stress response (beneficial in controlled dose)
- **Breathing:** May become rapid initially (control with slow exhale)

### What Happens in Contrast (Alternating)
- **Vascular exercise:** Alternating vasodilation and vasoconstriction
- **Circulatory stimulation:** "Pumping" effect on blood flow
- **Autonomic nervous system training:** Shifting between sympathetic
  and parasympathetic activation
- **Recovery support:** May reduce delayed onset muscle soreness
  (evidence moderate)

## Variations

### If this feels too intense
- [Reduce temperature contrast — warmer cool water, cooler warm water]
- [Shorten cool phase]
- [Use hand or foot bath instead of full body]
- [Skip cool phase entirely — warm-only practice is still valuable]
- [Return to a previous level in the progression]

### If you want to progress
- [Criteria for next level]
- [How to widen temperature contrast]
- [How to extend cool phase duration]
- [When to add more cycles]
- [Consider integration with cold-exposure-guide protocols]

### For different access
- **No bathtub:** Shower-based contrast (warm/cool water alternation)
- **Limited water:** Hand or foot bath with warm water and cool rinse
- **Shared bathroom:** Shorter protocols (10-15 minutes total)
- **Natural water access:** See additional safety guidance for
  natural water bodies

### For different times of day
- **Morning:** Contrast shower — energizing, supports alertness
- **Post-exercise:** Contrast therapy — may support recovery
- **Evening:** Warm bath (no cold) — supports relaxation and sleep
  (1-2 hours before bed, per Haghayegh et al., 2019)
