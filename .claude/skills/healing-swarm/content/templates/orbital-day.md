## Structure

```markdown
# Day [N]: [Day Title]

**Orbital Level:** [Bodily / Emotional / Mental / Transpersonal]
**Theme:** [Day's specific theme]
**Duration:** ~[X] minutes total (morning + midday + evening)

---

## Morning Practice ([X] minutes)

### Grounding Anchor (2-3 minutes)

[Standard grounding practice that appears every day. This is the
safety anchor — always start here, always return here if needed.]

1. Feel your feet on the floor (or body against the surface)
2. Take three slow breaths, exhaling longer than inhaling
3. Name three things you can hear right now
4. Notice the temperature of the air on your skin
5. Say silently: "I am here. I am grounded. I am safe."

*This grounding anchor is your home base. Return here at any time
during the practice if you feel overwhelmed or disoriented.*

---

### Today's Practice: [Practice Name] ([X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
[Clear description of today's practice]

**Evidence context:**
[Brief note on the research basis, if applicable]

**How to do it:**
1. [Step-by-step instructions]
2. [Specific to this day's orbital level and theme]
3. [Building on previous days' practices]
4. [New element introduced gradually]

**What you might notice:**
[Sensory/experiential cues appropriate to the orbital level]

**If this feels too much:**
[Specific modification for this day — always included]

---

### Integration (2-3 minutes)

1. [Return to grounding anchor]
2. [Brief body scan — how do you feel now?]
3. [Set a gentle intention for the day]
4. [Open eyes, move slowly]

*Take a moment before engaging with the day.*

---

## Midday Check-In (5 minutes)

### Self-Assessment

Pause wherever you are and notice:

**Body:** [1-2 questions about physical state]
- How does my body feel right now? (1 = very tense, 5 = very relaxed)

**Emotions:** [1-2 questions about emotional state]
- What is my predominant mood? (just notice, no need to change it)

**Groundedness:** [1-2 questions about integration]
- Do I feel connected to my body and present in this moment?
  (1 = very disconnected, 5 = very grounded)

### Mini-Practice (2 minutes)

[A brief version of the morning practice, adapted for midday —
can be done at a desk, in a car, anywhere]

---

## Evening Reflection (10-15 minutes)

### Settling Practice (5 minutes)

[Gentle practice to transition from the day. Simpler than morning
practice. Focused on releasing the day's activity.]

---

### Journal Prompt

**Today's question:**

> [Primary reflection question tied to the day's theme and
> orbital level]

**Guiding questions** (optional — use if the main question
doesn't spark reflection):

- [Sub-question 1]
- [Sub-question 2]
- [Sub-question 3]

*Write as much or as little as feels right. Drawing, voice
recording, or simply sitting with the question are all valid
alternatives to writing.*

---

### Closing

[Brief closing — gratitude, appreciation, or simple presence]

*Rest well. Tomorrow builds on today.*

---

## Safety Notes for Day [N]

[Day-specific safety considerations. These vary by orbital level:]

**Bodily orbital (Days 1-7):**
- Standard safety. If any practice causes physical pain, stop.
- Grounding anchor available at all times.

**Emotional orbital (Days 8-14):**
- You may encounter difficult emotions. This is normal.
- If emotional intensity persists beyond the practice, use grounding.
- If distress continues for more than 2 hours, contact support.

**Mental orbital (Days 15-19):**
- Observing thoughts can sometimes trigger existential questions.
- If you feel unmoored, return to body awareness (Phase 2).
- This is not a substitute for therapy.

**Transpersonal orbital (Days 20-21+):**
- ⚠ Enhanced safety applies.
- If you feel disconnected from reality, STOP and use grounding.
- Contact your identified support person if you feel distressed.
- It is completely fine to stay at the mental level and not proceed.
- These practices are exploratory, based on a theoretical model.

## Progress Tracker

At the end of each day, note:

| Dimension | Rating (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|:---:|-------|
| Physical groundedness | | |
| Emotional stability | | |
| Practice quality (subjective) | | |
| Sleep quality (last night) | | |
| Overall wellbeing | | |

**Readiness for tomorrow:** [Ready / Need another day at this level / Need a break]

*If you rate any dimension below 2 for two consecutive days, consider
taking an integration day before continuing.*
```

## Element Guidelines

### Grounding Anchor

**Purpose:** Safety anchor present every single day

**This section is identical every day.** It provides:
- Predictability and comfort
- A reliable "home base"
- Immediate grounding if needed

**The grounding anchor is NOT negotiable.** Every daily practice
starts with it and can return to it at any time.

### Morning Practice

**Purpose:** Primary practice for the day's orbital level

**Key principles by orbital level:**

| Orbital | Focus | Language | Safety Level |
|---------|-------|----------|:---:|
| Bodily (1-7) | Physical sensation | Concrete, tactile | Standard |
| Emotional (8-14) | Feeling tones | Gentle, permissive | Enhanced |
| Mental (15-19) | Thought patterns | Observational, spacious | Enhanced |
| Transpersonal (20+) | Expanded awareness | Open, carefully framed | Maximum |

**Progression within each orbital:**
- Days 1-2 of each orbital: Introduction and orientation
- Days 3-5: Deepening the practice
- Days 6-7: Integration and review
- Integration day: Rest, no new practices

### Midday Check-In

**Purpose:** Brief self-assessment and micro-practice

**Requirements:**
- Takes no more than 5 minutes
- Can be done anywhere
- Simple self-rating scale
- Mini-practice (2 minutes max)
- No intensity — just gentle noticing

### Evening Reflection

**Purpose:** Integration and journaling

**Journal prompt guidelines:**
- Open-ended, non-prescriptive
- Connected to the day's theme
- No "right answer"
- Writing alternatives offered (drawing, voice, sitting)
- Sub-questions optional

| Orbital Level | Journal Prompt Style |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Bodily | "What did your body tell you today?" |
| Emotional | "What emotion surprised you today?" |
| Mental | "What thought pattern did you notice repeating?" |
| Transpersonal | "What, if anything, shifted in your sense of self today?" |

### Safety Notes

**Purpose:** Day-specific safety considerations

**These MUST vary by orbital level.** Higher orbitals require
more prominent safety language.

**Safety escalation:**
```
Bodily:        [Standard safety — stop if pain]
Emotional:     [Enhanced — grounding available, contact support if persistent]
Mental:        [Enhanced — existential normalization, return to body]
Transpersonal: [Maximum — ⚠ warning, grounding protocol, support person, ok to stop]
```

### Progress Tracker

**Purpose:** Self-monitoring across the journey

**Key features:**
- Simple 1-5 scale (not clinical)
- Qualitative notes encouraged
- "Readiness for tomorrow" self-assessment
- Automatic integration day trigger (2 consecutive days below 2)

---

## Accessibility Guidelines

### Physical Accessibility
- All practices adaptable to any body position
- No physical requirements beyond breathing
- Movement is optional

### Cognitive Accessibility
- Short, clear instructions
- Consistent daily structure (predictable)
- One new element per day maximum

### Psychological Safety
- Grounding anchor ALWAYS available
- Permission to stop ALWAYS present
- Safety notes appropriate to orbital level
- Progress tracker enables self-monitoring
