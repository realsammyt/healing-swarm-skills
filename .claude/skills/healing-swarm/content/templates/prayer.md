## Element Guidelines

### Settling Instruction

Purpose: Help the reader arrive in the present moment

**Examples:**
- "Close your eyes. Take a breath. Let your body settle."
- "Find a comfortable position. Allow your breathing to slow."
- "Place one hand over your heart. Feel its rhythm."

**Guidelines:**
- Keep brief (1-3 sentences)
- Include body and breath
- Italicize to distinguish from prayer text

### Opening Address

Purpose: Invoke or address the sacred presence

**Examples:**
- "Raphael, angel of healing, whose name means 'God heals'..."
- "Source of all life, wellspring of healing..."
- "To the wisdom within this body..."
- "Shekhinah, divine presence, dweller in all things..."

**Guidelines:**
- Name the entity/concept clearly
- Include traditional epithet or description
- Set tone for the prayer (reverent, intimate, etc.)

### Prayer Body

Purpose: Express the intention, petition, or contemplation

**Elements:**
- Statements of intention
- Petitions for support
- Acknowledgments of truth
- Visualization cues (in italics)

**Pacing:**
- Short lines for breathing space
- Longer lines for flowing expression
- "..." for pauses
- Line breaks for emphasis

**Example structure:**
```
I come to this moment
seeking [intention]

*[Visualization: Imagine...]*

May [petition 1]
May [petition 2]
May [petition 3]

*[Pause. Breathe.]*

I acknowledge [truth]
I trust [affirmation]
```

### Visualization Cues

Purpose: Guide inner imagery during prayer

**Format:** Always italicized, set apart

**Examples:**
- "*Imagine a green light surrounding the area that needs healing.*"
- "*See yourself held in gentle, healing hands.*"
- "*Feel warmth spreading through your body.*"

**Guidelines:**
- Multi-sensory when possible (see, feel, sense)
- Invitational ("imagine" / "you might notice")
- Brief—support the prayer, don't replace it

### Closing

Purpose: Complete the prayer with gratitude and affirmation

**Elements:**
- Expression of thanks
- Affirmation of trust/faith
- Traditional closing word

**Examples:**
```
I give thanks for this breath,
this body,
this moment of care.

May it be so.
Amen.
```

### Attribution Block

Purpose: Honor the source and ensure proper credit

**Required elements:**
- Tradition of origin
- Time period (if known)
- Primary source (if applicable)
- Adaptation notes (if modified from original)
- Acknowledgment statement

**Example:**
```
*Tradition: Jewish mystical healing*
*Source: Adapted from Sefer Raziel HaMalakh invocation formulas*
*Era: Medieval (Amsterdam edition, 1701)*
*Adaptation: Simplified for accessibility while maintaining structure*
*Acknowledgment: We honor the Kabbalistic lineage that preserved these practices*
```

## Inclusivity Guidelines

### Belief-Neutral Options

For users with various or no religious background:

```
INSTEAD OF                      USE
"O Lord God..."                 "Source of healing..." / "Life within..."
"We pray to you..."             "We turn our attention to..."
"Through Jesus Christ..."       [Omit or use "So be it"]
"By the power of..."            "With the intention of..."
```

### Cultural Respect

- Always attribute tradition of origin
- Don't blend traditions without noting
- Respect closed practices
- Offer secular alternatives when appropriate

## Example: Complete Prayer

```markdown
# Prayer for Healing Light

*From the Jewish mystical tradition*

---

## Settling

*Close your eyes. Place your hands gently on the part of your body
that calls for healing. Take three slow breaths.*

---

## Opening

Raphael, angel of healing,
whose name means "God heals,"
I invite your presence in this moment
as I tend to this body.

---

## Body

You who traveled with Tobias,
you who restored sight to the blind,
I call upon your healing light
to illuminate what needs attention.

*Imagine a soft green light beginning to glow
around your hands, around the area of focus.*

May this light carry healing intention
to every cell, every tissue, every fiber.

May blockage dissolve.
May circulation flow freely.
May the body's wisdom do its work.

*Feel the warmth of healing presence.*

I do not demand a miracle.
I ask only for support—
for my body's natural capacity to heal,
for courage to rest when rest is needed,
for patience with the pace of recovery.

---

## Closing

I give thanks for this moment of attention,
for the traditions that teach us healing prayer,
for this body that carries me through life.

May healing flow where healing is needed.
May I trust the process.
May I rest in peace.

Amen.
