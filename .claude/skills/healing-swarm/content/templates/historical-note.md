## Element Guidelines

### Origins Section

**Purpose:** Establish clear provenance and original context

**Include:**
- Specific tradition (not vague "Eastern" or "ancient")
- Geographic origin
- Time period with dates (not just "ancient")
- Earliest documented source

**Example:**
```markdown
#### Origins

**Tradition:** Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
**Region:** China, primarily Yellow River region
**Era:** Classical period (Han dynasty, 206 BCE - 220 CE)
**First documented:** Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon),
compiled 300-100 BCE

The concept of acupoints and meridians emerged from centuries of
empirical observation by Chinese healers. The Huangdi Neijing
systematized this knowledge into a coherent theoretical framework,
describing 365 acupoints along 12 primary meridians. This text
remains foundational to TCM practice today.
```

### Historical Development

**Purpose:** Show how the practice evolved over time

**Include:**
- Key time periods or transmission points
- Significant changes or developments
- Cross-cultural influences if relevant
- Notable practitioners or texts

**Example:**
```markdown
#### Historical Development

**Key periods:**

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) | Theoretical systematization in Neijing |
| Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) | Standardization of point locations |
| Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) | Creation of bronze acupuncture models |
| Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE) | Comprehensive text Zhenjiu Dacheng compiled |
| 20th Century | Introduction to West; scientific study begins |

During the Tang dynasty, imperial medical education standardized
acupoint locations and techniques. The Song dynasty saw the creation
of life-size bronze figures with marked points, used for teaching
and examination. These models helped preserve precise knowledge
across generations.
```

### Traditional Understanding

**Purpose:** Present the practice from within its own worldview

**Guidelines:**
- Use the tradition's own concepts and terminology
- Don't immediately translate into scientific terms
- Show respect for the internal logic
- Note where understanding differs from modern science

**Example:**
```markdown
#### Traditional Understanding

In TCM theory, the point known as LI-4 (Hegu, 合谷, "Joining Valley")
is one of the most important points in the entire system. Located
in the webbing between thumb and index finger, it is understood as
a powerful point for moving qi and blood throughout the upper body.

Traditional indications include headache, facial pain, toothache,
sore throat, and delayed labor. The classics describe it as the
"command point" for the face and head—meaning it has particular
influence over these regions regardless of the specific complaint.

TCM practitioners understand its effectiveness in terms of its
position on the Large Intestine meridian and its energetic
properties: it disperses stagnation, releases the exterior, and
regulates the flow of qi.
```

### Contemporary Practice

**Purpose:** Show current state of the practice

**Include:**
- Whether it's a living, historical, or reconstructed tradition
- How it's practiced today
- Significant modern adaptations
- Current communities of practice

**Example:**
```markdown
#### Contemporary Practice

**Current status:** Living tradition

LI-4 remains one of the most commonly used acupuncture points
worldwide. It is taught in all TCM educational programs and
used daily by practitioners across diverse clinical settings.

Modern research has investigated this point for pain management,
particularly for headache and dental pain. While the traditional
indications remain the foundation, contemporary practitioners
often integrate this knowledge with biomedical understanding.

Self-acupressure on this point has become popular in integrative
health contexts, taught as a simple technique for tension relief
and pain management.
```

### Our Adaptation

**Purpose:** Be transparent about modifications

**Include:**
- What has been changed from traditional form
- Why changes were made
- What has been preserved
- How to access traditional form if interested

**Example:**
```markdown
#### Our Adaptation

In this application, we present a simplified self-acupressure
protocol for LI-4 based on traditional TCM principles:

**Preserved:**
- Traditional point location
- Core indications (tension, headache)
- Breathing coordination
- Intention/attention component

**Adapted:**
- Simplified from professional technique to self-care
- Removed advanced needle techniques
- Added accessibility modifications for injured hands
- Integrated with other practices (prayer, visualization)

**Note:** This self-care adaptation is not a substitute for
professional acupuncture treatment. Those interested in the
full traditional practice should seek a licensed acupuncturist.

## Historical Context

### Psalm 6 as Healing Prayer
*Mizmor L'David (מזמור לדוד)*

---

#### Origins

**Tradition:** Jewish liturgical and mystical practice
**Region:** Ancient Israel / Diaspora
**Era:** Ancient composition (attributed to King David, ~1000 BCE);
healing use documented in medieval period
**First documented for healing:** Sefer Shimmush Tehillim
(Book of the Uses of Psalms), medieval

Psalm 6 is one of the seven Penitential Psalms in Jewish tradition.
While the psalm itself dates to the biblical period, its specific
use as a healing prayer is documented in medieval Jewish magical
and mystical texts. The Sefer Shimmush Tehillim assigns specific
psalms to various conditions, with Psalm 6 indicated for healing
illness.

---

#### Historical Development

**Key periods:**

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| Biblical (c. 1000 BCE) | Psalm composed, liturgical use |
| Second Temple (516 BCE-70 CE) | Temple worship, communal recitation |
| Medieval (500-1500 CE) | Kabbalistic healing applications develop |
| Early Modern (1600s-1800s) | Publication of Shimmush Tehillim texts |
| Contemporary | Integration into healing ceremonies |

During the medieval period, Jewish mystics developed elaborate
systems for using psalms as healing instruments. Each psalm was
understood to carry specific spiritual power based on its content,
its divine names, and its gematria (numerical value). Psalm 6's
themes of suffering and restoration made it particularly suited
for those experiencing illness.

---

#### Traditional Understanding

Within Jewish mystical tradition, the psalms are understood not
merely as prayers but as vehicles of divine energy. Reciting
Psalm 6 is believed to invoke divine mercy and healing presence.

The psalm's opening cry—"O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger"—
acknowledges human frailty while appealing to divine compassion.
Traditional practice involves reciting the psalm with kavvanah
(focused intention) while visualizing healing light.

Some traditions prescribe reciting the psalm a specific number
of times (often 7 or 12) or at specific times (sunset, upon
waking). The practice may be accompanied by the lighting of
candles, the use of healing divine names, or integration with
other prayers.

---

#### Contemporary Practice

**Current status:** Living tradition

Psalm 6 continues to be recited for healing in traditional Jewish
communities. It appears in many prayer books' sections for visiting
the sick (bikur cholim) and is included in various healing ceremony
liturgies.

Contemporary Jewish healing centers and synagogue healing services
often include this psalm. Some practitioners combine it with other
healing modalities, including music, meditation, and hands-on
healing within appropriate Jewish contexts.

---

#### Our Adaptation

We present a contemplative reading of Psalm 6 adapted for
personal healing practice:

**Preserved:**
- Traditional Hebrew text with translation
- Meditative recitation approach
- Intention/kavvanah focus
- Healing application context

**Adapted:**
- Guidance for personal (not communal) practice
- Integration with visualization techniques
- Breathing coordination added
- Simplified from elaborate Kabbalistic protocol

This adaptation draws on the tradition while making it accessible
for personal healing practice. Those interested in traditional
Kabbalistic healing practices should consult with knowledgeable
practitioners within the Jewish community.
