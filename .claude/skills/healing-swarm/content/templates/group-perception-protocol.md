## Structure

```markdown
# [Exercise Name]: Group Perception Protocol

**Participants:** [N people, range]
**Duration:** [X minutes]
**Facilitator Required:** [Yes / No / Recommended]
**Materials:** [What's needed]
**Space:** [Room requirements]
**Difficulty:** [Introductory / Intermediate / Advanced]

---

## Overview

[2-3 sentences describing the exercise and what it reveals about
language, perception, and collective awareness.]

> **Note:** Group perception exercises can produce unexpected emotional
> or perceptual responses. A facilitator experienced with contemplative
> practices is recommended for all but the simplest exercises.

---

## Consent

**Read aloud before every session:**

"This exercise involves [brief description of what will happen].
You may notice shifts in how you perceive [language / objects /
yourself]. This is expected and temporary.

You are not expected to share your inner experience unless you
choose to. You may stop participating at any time without
explanation. There is no correct experience — whatever you notice
is valid, including noticing nothing.

Does everyone consent to participate?"

[Wait for explicit verbal consent from each participant]
[Anyone who does not consent should feel welcomed to observe
silently or leave without judgment]

---

## Setup

### Space
- [Room arrangement — circle, pairs, etc.]
- [Lighting, noise level, privacy]
- [Central object if needed]

### Materials
- [Timer, objects, paper, etc.]
- [Facilitator notes/script]

### Facilitator Preparation
- [Read through the full exercise before facilitating]
- [Prepare grounding protocol in case of distress]
- [Have water available]
- [Know when to pause or stop the exercise]

## The Exercise

### Part 1: [Opening / Warm-up] ([X] minutes)

**Facilitator says:**
"[Script for opening — setting the frame, inviting attention]"

**Participants do:**
[Clear instruction]

**Facilitator watches for:**
[Signs of engagement, confusion, distress]

---

### Part 2: [Core Exercise] ([X] minutes)

**Facilitator says:**
"[Script for main exercise]"

**Participants do:**
[Step-by-step instruction]

**Transitions:**
[How to signal phase changes — bell, voice, gesture]

**If someone becomes distressed:**
1. Approach calmly
2. Offer to step outside together
3. Run Pocket Exit grounding
4. No pressure to return to the exercise
5. Check in after the session

---

### Part 3: [Closing / Transition] ([X] minutes)

**Facilitator says:**
"[Script for transitioning out of the exercise]"

**Participants do:**
[Return to ordinary awareness, grounding]

---

## Debrief ([X] minutes)

### Guidelines
- Sharing is optional — no one is required to speak
- Listen without interpreting others' experiences
- "What did you notice?" not "What did you feel?"
- No right or wrong observations
- If someone shares something intense, acknowledge without fixing

### Suggested Questions
- "[Primary debrief question related to the exercise]"
- "[Secondary question about the contrast between phases]"
- "[Open question: anything else you want to name?]"

### Facilitator Notes
- [Common responses to expect]
- [How to handle silence in the debrief]
- [How to close the debrief gracefully]

---

## Variations

### For fewer participants (2-3)
[Adapted version]

### For larger groups (12+)
[Adapted version — usually small group breakouts]

### If the exercise falls flat
[What to do if participants don't engage — usually simplify]

### For different settings
[Corporate workshop, retreat, classroom, therapy group]

## Facilitator Troubleshooting

| Issue | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Participant becomes distressed | Step outside together. Run grounding. No pressure to return. Follow up afterward |
| Group won't stop talking during silence | Gently redirect: "Let's return to silence." If persistent, shorten the silence and debrief |
| No one shares in debrief | That's fine. Offer one observation yourself, then sit with silence. Close gracefully |
| Someone dominates the debrief | "Thank you — let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet" |
| Participant refuses consent | Welcome them to observe or leave. No shame. Move on without discussion |
| Exercise produces unexpected laughter | Normal. Laughter is a healthy response to seeing cognitive habits. Let it happen |
| Someone reports persistent disorientation | Run full grounding. If it doesn't resolve in 10 minutes, suggest they contact a mental health professional |

---

## Safety Notes

- Facilitator must NOT be a participant (cannot hold space and
  go deep simultaneously)
- Water available for all participants
- Quiet space for anyone who needs to step out
- Grounding protocol (Pocket Exit) ready for any participant
- Mental health professional contact information available
- These exercises are NOT therapy — do not process trauma in this context
```

## Available Exercise Types

### Exercise 1: Collective Label Delay (10 min)

**Setup:** Circle of 3-12 people. One shared object in center.

**Phases:**
1. **Name Storm** (2 min): Everyone takes turns naming the object
   with as many labels as possible. Speed matters. Flood the air.
2. **Silence** (3 min): Everyone looks at the object. No one speaks.
   See past every name just uttered.
3. **Texture Report** (5 min): Each person describes the object using
   only sensations — temperature, weight, texture, light quality —
   never using the object's name. If someone slips, the group hums.

**Debrief:** "What showed up in the silence that wasn't there during
the naming?"

---

### Exercise 2: Pronoun Relay (15 min)

**Setup:** Circle of 3-6 people.

**Phases:**
1. Person A tells a 2-minute story about their day, replacing every
   "I" with "the body" or "the organism"
2. Person B retells that same story replacing "I" with "the voice"
3. Person C retells it replacing "I" with "the pattern"
4. Group discussion: Which version felt most honest? Most disturbing?

**Debrief:** "What happens to the story when 'I' is removed?"

---

### Exercise 3: Meaning Collapse Circle (15 min)

**Setup:** Circle of 3-12 people.

**Phases:**
1. Choose one phrase everyone has heard hundreds of times
   (e.g., "I'm fine," "It is what it is," "That makes sense")
2. Everyone repeats it in unison, increasingly slowly, for 3 minutes,
   until it becomes pure sound
3. 2 minutes of silence
4. Each person shares one word or image that formed in the silence

**Debrief:** "What was it like when the meaning left?"

---

### Exercise 4: Map-Maker's Interrogation (20 min)

**Setup:** Circle of 3-8 people.

**Phases:**
1. One person presents a belief, opinion, or "fact" they hold
2. The group asks only these questions, in order:
   - "Who drew this map?"
   - "What did they leave out?"
   - "Where does the map want you NOT to go?"
   - "What would change if you burned the map?"
3. Presenter does not defend — only listens and journals
4. 5 minutes of silent reflection
5. Presenter shares one honest observation

**Debrief:** "What's different about questioning the frame instead
of the content?"

---

### Exercise 5: Conversion Drill (15 min, pairs)

**Setup:** Pairs, seated facing each other.

**Phases:**
1. Partner A states an abstract emotional complaint:
   "I'm overwhelmed," "I feel stuck," "I'm burned out"
2. Partner B guides through Conversion-3:
   - **Anchor:** Name a physical object you can feel right now
   - **Motion:** What simple verb describes what that object does?
   - **Tilt:** Add one sensory twist that makes it alive
3. Example: "I'm overwhelmed" → "Feels like holding a wet sponge
   that won't stop getting heavier"
4. Swap roles. Repeat three rounds.

**Debrief:** "What changed when the feeling had a body?"

---

### Exercise 6: Silence Sit (30 min, weekly)

**Setup:** Any number of people. No facilitator needed.

**Phases:**
1. Gather. Sit. Set a 30-minute timer
2. No speaking. No reading. No devices. No eye contact
   (eyes open, gaze soft or downward)
3. When timer sounds: one minute of shared eye contact in pairs
4. Optional 10-minute open debrief: "What did the silence sound like?"

**Note:** This is the most challenging group protocol. The book's
deepest claim is that silence is not absence but the *parent* of
language. This protocol lets a group discover that together.

## Consent Framework Details

### For All Group Exercises

**Before the exercise:**
- Explain what will happen in concrete terms
- Explain that experiences vary and all are valid
- State the right to withdraw at any time
- Get explicit verbal consent from each person
- Offer observation-only option

**During the exercise:**
- Facilitator monitors for distress
- Anyone can step out at any time
- No questions asked about leaving

**After the exercise:**
- Sharing is optional
- "What did you notice?" not "What did you feel?"
- No interpreting others' experiences
- No pressure for "breakthrough" narratives
- Facilitator checks in with anyone who seemed distressed

### Power Dynamic Awareness

- Teacher/facilitator should not be paired with students in pair exercises
- Senior/junior dynamics acknowledged in workplace settings
- No one should feel their job, grade, or standing depends on participation
- Consent must be truly free — no social pressure

## Attribution

These group exercises draw from:

- **Chase Hughes** — *Tongue: A Cognitive Hazard* (2024). Collective
  label delay, pronoun relay, and conversion drill concepts
- **Zen Buddhist practice** — Sangha (community practice) traditions
  of group silence and shared inquiry
- **Quaker meeting** — Tradition of communal silence with optional
  speaking from inner conviction
- **Focusing (Eugene Gendlin)** — Felt sense work in pairs, embodied
  language for inner experience
- **Phenomenological inquiry** — Group bracketing and shared
  investigation of experience

*We honor each tradition's distinct context and purpose.*

*"Silence is not absence — it's the parent of language.
Listen long enough and you'll hear where words come from."*
