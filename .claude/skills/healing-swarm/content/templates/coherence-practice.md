# [Practice Name]: Coherence Meditation

**Inspired by:** The self-allusive meditation research of Dr. Jacobo
Grinberg-Zylberbaum (UNAM, 1970s–1994)
**Duration:** [X minutes]
**Difficulty:** [Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced]
**Best for:** [What this practice supports]

---

## Overview

[2-3 sentences describing the practice and its basis in Grinberg's
self-allusive meditation — simultaneous awareness of body, emotions,
thoughts, and external stimuli. Note evidence level.]

> **Evidence note:** Preliminary EEG research suggests that this style
> of meditation may enhance interhemispheric coherence (alpha and theta
> wave synchronization). These findings are based on small sample sizes
> with limited independent replication.

## Before You Begin

### You'll Need
- [Duration] of uninterrupted time
- A quiet, comfortable space
- Seated position (chair, cushion, or lying down)

### Best Times to Practice
- [Recommended timing]

### Cautions
- [Any contraindications]
- If you have a history of dissociation or psychosis, consult a mental
  health professional before beginning this practice
- This practice complements but does not replace medical or psychological care

*If you feel overwhelmed at any point, open your eyes, feel your feet
on the floor, and take several normal breaths. You can stop at any time.*

---

## The Practice

### Phase 1: Settling (2-3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Arrive and settle into present-moment awareness.

**How to do it:**
1. [Settling instruction — posture, eyes, breath]
2. [Grounding cue — feel contact with seat/floor]
3. [Initial breath awareness — 3-5 natural breaths]
4. [Intention setting — gentle, non-striving]

**What you might notice:**
[Mind may be busy — this is normal. No need to quiet it.]

*Duration: [X] minutes*

---

### Phase 2: Body Awareness (4-5 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Bring awareness to the physical body — sensations, temperature,
pressure, movement.

**How to do it:**
1. [Begin at feet or crown — systematic awareness]
2. [Move through regions of the body]
3. [Notice sensations without changing them]
4. [Include areas of comfort AND discomfort equally]

**What you might notice:**
[Warmth, tingling, pulsing, stillness, numbness — all valid.
Some areas may feel vivid, others blank. Both are fine.]

*Duration: [X] minutes*

---

### Phase 3: Emotional Field (4-5 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Expand awareness to include the emotional landscape — WITHOUT losing
body awareness.

**How to do it:**
1. [Maintain body awareness from Phase 2]
2. [Add attention to emotional tone — mood, feeling-state]
3. [Notice emotions as sensations in the body]
4. [Neither amplify nor suppress — just notice]

**What you might notice:**
[Subtle emotional tones you weren't aware of. Emotions may shift
or intensify briefly. Body awareness helps you stay grounded.]

*Duration: [X] minutes*

---

### Phase 4: Thought Awareness (4-5 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Expand further to include thought patterns — while maintaining
body AND emotional awareness.

**How to do it:**
1. [Maintain body + emotional awareness]
2. [Add attention to the thinking process itself]
3. [Notice thoughts arising and passing — not their content]
4. [Observe the pace, texture, and quality of thinking]

**What you might notice:**
[This is challenging — adding a third domain of awareness.
It's normal for one domain to fade as another comes forward.
Gently re-include what fades. This IS the practice.]

*Duration: [X] minutes*

---

### Phase 5: Unified Field (4-5 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Hold all domains simultaneously — body, emotion, thought, and
external sounds/environment. This is what Grinberg called
"high-inclusion" or self-allusive awareness.

**How to do it:**
1. [Body awareness still present]
2. [Emotional field still present]
3. [Thought observation still present]
4. [Now include sounds, air temperature, the space around you]
5. [Hold it all at once — lightly, without gripping]

**What you might notice:**
[A sense of expansion or spaciousness. Moments where all
domains are present simultaneously, then collapse — then
expand again. The oscillation IS the practice. You may
experience a settled, coherent quality of attention.
Or you may not — both are valid.]

*Duration: [X] minutes*

---

### Phase 6: Integration (2-3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Gently release the practice and return to ordinary awareness.

**How to do it:**
1. [Let go of the effort to hold all domains]
2. [Return to simple breath awareness]
3. [Feel your body in contact with the seat/floor]
4. [Notice the space around you — sounds, temperature]
5. [Gently open your eyes when ready]
6. [Take a moment before moving on]

**What you might notice:**
[A sense of calm alertness. Or tiredness. Or nothing
particular. All are valid responses to the practice.]

*Take a moment before moving on with your day.*

---

## Variations

### If you have limited mobility
[Adaptation — can be done lying down, any position]

### If this feels too intense
[Gentler option — stay with body awareness only, shorter duration]

### To deepen the practice
[Advanced variation — extended unified field, subtler awareness]

### For different situations
[Seated at work, walking version, morning vs evening adaptation]

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Suggestion |
|-------|------------|
| Can't hold multiple domains at once | Normal, especially at first. Think of it like peripheral vision — you don't focus on everything, you soften focus to include more |
| Keep losing body awareness | Anchor to one specific sensation (e.g., breath) as a home base, then expand from there |
| Mind is very busy | That's fine — a busy mind is still a mind you can observe. The observing is the practice |
| Fell asleep | Try sitting upright, practicing earlier in the day, or shortening the duration |
| Don't feel anything special | Many people don't, especially early on. Coherence effects may be subtle or cumulative |

---

## Building a Practice

**Frequency:** Daily practice is ideal. Even 3-4 times per week
can be beneficial. Consistency matters more than duration.

**Duration:** Allow 2-4 weeks of regular practice before evaluating.
Grinberg's research used 20-minute sessions over several weeks.

**Progression:**
- Week 1-2: Focus on Phases 1-3 (settling, body, emotion)
- Week 3-4: Add Phase 4 (thought awareness)
- Month 2+: Full 6-phase practice with unified field
- Ongoing: Deepen the quality of simultaneous awareness

---

*This practice is inspired by the self-allusive meditation research of
Dr. Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum (1946–1994), a neurophysiologist at UNAM
who studied interhemispheric coherence during meditation. His research
is classified as preliminary (small sample sizes, limited independent
replication). This practice is offered as contemplative exploration,
not as a validated therapeutic intervention.*

*This practice complements but does not replace medical or psychological
care. Consult your healthcare provider before beginning any new health
practice.*

## Element Guidelines

### Overview

**Purpose:** Introduce the practice and its evidence basis

**Requirements:**
- Name Grinberg and UNAM
- State evidence level (preliminary)
- Note small sample sizes
- Describe self-allusive awareness accessibly

**Example:**
```markdown
## Overview

This practice guides you through Grinberg's self-allusive meditation —
a progressive expansion of awareness through body, emotions, thoughts,
and unified attention. Preliminary EEG research suggests this practice
may enhance interhemispheric coherence (synchronization between brain
hemispheres). These findings are based on small studies with limited
replication, but the practice itself draws on well-established
contemplative principles.
```

### Phase Transitions

**Purpose:** Guide the shift from one awareness domain to the next

**Key principle:** Each new phase ADDS to previous awareness — it does
not replace it. This additive quality is the core of self-allusive meditation.

| Phase Transition | Key Instruction |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Settling → Body | "Now bring attention to your body..." |
| Body → Emotion | "While keeping body awareness, also notice..." |
| Emotion → Thought | "Maintaining body and emotion, now also observe..." |
| Thought → Unified | "Holding all three, now also include..." |
| Unified → Integration | "Gently release the effort to hold all domains..." |

**Language guidelines:**
- Use "expand to include" not "shift to"
- Emphasize addition, not replacement
- Normalize difficulty: "This is challenging — that's the practice"

### Unified Field Phase

**Purpose:** The culmination of self-allusive awareness

**This is the most distinctive phase.** Guide it carefully:

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Use "lightly hold" or "softly include" | Use "concentrate on everything" |
| Normalize oscillation (awareness expanding and contracting) | Suggest it should be stable |
| Offer the metaphor of peripheral vision | Promise specific experiences |
| Acknowledge this is challenging | Frame difficulty as failure |

**Example:**
```markdown
### Phase 5: Unified Field

Imagine your awareness like your visual field — you don't have to
stare at each thing individually. Instead, soften your focus so that
body, emotions, thoughts, and the space around you are all present
at once. Like peripheral vision for the whole of your experience.

This will come and go. You'll hold it for a moment, then it collapses.
Then it opens again. The oscillation between unified and collapsed IS
the practice. Each time you re-expand, you're exercising this capacity.
```

### Evidence Notes

**Purpose:** Honest framing of the research basis

**Required in every practice:**
- Grinberg's name and UNAM affiliation
- "Preliminary research" label
- Small sample sizes noted
- Limited replication noted
- "Suggests" not "proves"

**Template:**
```markdown
> **Evidence note:** This practice is inspired by the research of
> Dr. Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum at UNAM. Preliminary EEG studies
> suggest [specific finding]. These findings are based on small
> sample sizes with limited independent replication. [Broader
> evidence note if applicable — e.g., mainstream meditation research.]
```
