# [Practice Name]: Language Awareness Practice

**Inspired by:** Cognitive deautomatization research, contemplative
traditions (Zen, Dzogchen, Phenomenology), and Chase Hughes' *Tongue*
**Level:** [Observation / Interruption / Substitution / Integration]
**Duration:** [X minutes]
**Focus:** [What this practice develops]
**Best for:** [Who benefits most]

---

## Overview

[2-3 sentences describing the practice and its basis in cognitive
deautomatization research. Note evidence level.]

> **Evidence note:** Research on semantic satiation (Jakobovits &
> Lambert, 1962) and cognitive deautomatization (Deikman, 1966)
> suggests that attention to automatic mental processes can reveal
> habitual perceptual patterns. Mindfulness research broadly supports
> the value of observing cognitive habits. These practices are offered
> as contemplative exploration, not as validated therapeutic interventions.

## Before You Begin

### You'll Need
- [Duration] of uninterrupted time
- A quiet, comfortable space
- Seated position (chair, cushion, or floor)
- [Any specific materials: a physical book, an object, etc.]

### Important Safety Information

**These practices temporarily change how you experience thoughts
and self-perception.** This is expected and usually resolves within
minutes after practice. However:

- **Do not practice** if you have active psychosis, dissociative
  disorders, severe depersonalization, or are in acute mental
  health crisis
- **Always have grounding available** (see Grounding section below)
- **Stop immediately** if you feel panicked, severely disoriented,
  or disconnected from reality in a way that frightens you
- These practices complement but do not replace mental health treatment

*You can stop at any time. Stopping is always a valid choice.*

### Grounding Anchor (Learn This First)

**Pocket Exit — memorize before starting:**
1. Tongue tip to roof of mouth, behind front teeth
2. Left thumb to sternum center, press lightly
3. Breathe: in for 4 heartbeats through nose, out for 6
4. Look at the nearest object — name it deliberately
5. Say one useful number aloud

*This is your anchor. Use it whenever you need to return to
ordinary awareness.*

## The Practice

### Phase 1: [Settling / Arrival] (1-2 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Arrive and ground yourself before beginning.

**How to do it:**
1. [Posture, eyes, breath]
2. [Run Pocket Exit once as preparation]
3. [Set intention: "I'm going to observe how my mind names things"]
4. [3 natural breaths]

**What you might notice:**
[Mind may already be busy naming — that's the beginning of the practice]

*Duration: [X] minutes*

---

### Phase 2: [Core Practice] ([X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
[Clear description of the practice]

**How to do it:**
1. [Step-by-step instruction — one instruction per step]
2. [Clear, concrete language]
3. [Include what to do when the mind wanders]
4. [Include what to do if it feels too intense]

**What you might notice:**
[Range of possible experiences, all normalized]
[Include "nothing in particular" as valid]

*If this feels too intense, use the Pocket Exit and return to
normal awareness. You can try again another day.*

*Duration: [X] minutes*

---

### Phase 3: [Grounding / Return] (2-3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Return to ordinary, language-engaged awareness.

**How to do it:**
1. [Let go of the practice — allow naming to resume naturally]
2. [Run Pocket Exit: tongue, thumb, breathe, name, number]
3. [Look around the room and deliberately name 5 things you see]
4. [Feel your body in the chair/on the floor]
5. [Say your name, today's date, where you are]
6. [Wait until language feels normal before moving on]

**What you might notice:**
[Sense of freshness in perception. Or tiredness. Or nothing
particular. All are valid responses.]

*Take a full minute before moving on with your day.*

---

## Variations

### If this feels too intense
[Shorter duration, simpler version, focus on grounding only]

### If nothing seems to happen
[Normalize this — subtlety is the nature of the practice.
The noticing of "nothing" IS something.]

### To deepen the practice
[Advanced variation — only for those comfortable at current level]

### For different situations
[Morning, midday, evening adaptations]

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Suggestion |
|-------|------------|
| Can't stop naming things | This IS the practice — noticing how persistent naming is. Don't fight it; just observe |
| Feel anxious or disoriented | Use Pocket Exit immediately. Return to full naming. Try shorter sessions next time |
| Practice feels pointless | Subtlety is normal. Keep sessions short. Review journal after 2 weeks for patterns |
| Mind wanders constantly | Not a problem — noticing the wandering is the practice. Gently return to the exercise |
| Persistent sense of unreality after practice | Use full Reintegration Ritual. If it persists for more than an hour, contact a mental health professional |
| Strong emotional response | Allow it. Breathe normally. Use Pocket Exit if needed. Emotional responses to seeing cognitive habits are normal |
| Want to stop mid-practice | Always valid. Use Pocket Exit and stop. You can return to the practice anytime |

## Building a Practice

**Frequency:** 3-5 times per week is ideal. Daily is fine.
Start with short sessions (3-5 minutes) and build gradually.

**Duration:** Allow 2 weeks at each level before progressing.
The goal is not to "level up" — it's to develop genuine
familiarity with pre-linguistic awareness.

**Progression:**
- Level 1 (Weeks 1-2): Observation — notice the naming
- Level 2 (Weeks 3-4): Interruption — create gaps
- Level 3 (Weeks 5-6): Substitution — replace labels with sensation
- Level 4 (Weeks 7-8): Integration — flexible engagement

**Tracking:** Keep a "Perception Journal" noting:
- **Catches**: moments you noticed language doing something automatic
- **Gaps**: moments of wordless perception, however brief
- **Survivors**: words or phrases that resisted dissolution

## Background

### About Cognitive Deautomatization

The term "deautomatization" was coined by Arthur Deikman (1966) to
describe the process of undoing automatic perceptual and cognitive
patterns through sustained attention. It is the mechanism behind many
contemplative practices across traditions.

### Cross-Tradition Parallels

- **Zen Buddhism** — Shikantaza (just sitting): non-conceptual awareness
  without object. Koan practice: using paradox to break conceptual mind.
- **Dzogchen** — Rigpa: recognition of awareness prior to conceptual
  overlay. The "natural state" before labeling.
- **Phenomenology** — Husserl's epoché: bracketing assumptions to see
  "the things themselves." Merleau-Ponty's embodied perception.
- **Vipassana** — Bare attention: observing mental processes without
  adding interpretation. Noting practice.
- **Chase Hughes** — *Tongue: A Cognitive Hazard* (2024): modern
  behavioral framing of language as automatic perception filter.

*We honor each tradition's distinct context. The exercises here are
modern adaptations drawing on shared principles.*

### Key Research

- **Jakobovits & Lambert (1962)** — Semantic satiation: repeated exposure
  to a word reduces its perceived meaning.
- **Deikman (1966)** — "Deautomatization and the Mystic Experience."
  Foundational paper on how attention reverses cognitive automation.
- **Lutz et al. (2004)** — Long-term meditators show enhanced gamma
  synchrony, suggesting altered perceptual processing.
- **Mindfulness research** (meta-analyses) broadly supports observational
  practices for cognitive flexibility.

*Note: Direct research on the specific exercises in this protocol is
limited. The practices draw on well-established contemplative principles
with varying levels of clinical evidence.*

---

*This practice complements but does not replace medical or psychological
care. If you have any mental health conditions, consult your provider
before beginning practices that alter perception or self-awareness.*

## Element Guidelines

### Safety Section

**Purpose:** Ensure psychological safety before every practice

**Requirements:**
- Contraindication list (psychosis, dissociation, PTSD, mania)
- Grounding protocol (Pocket Exit) taught before practice
- Permission to stop
- Mental health professional referral language
- "Not a replacement for treatment" disclaimer

**This section must NEVER be shortened or softened.**
Language awareness practices can be destabilizing. The safety
section is the most important part of every protocol.

### Core Practice Phase

**Purpose:** Guide the deautomatization exercise

**Key principles:**
- One instruction per step
- Concrete language ("look at the object" not "enter awareness")
- Include what to do when it feels too intense
- Include what to do when nothing happens
- No target experiences or outcomes

**Language:**
- "Notice what happens" not "You will experience"
- "Some people find..." not "You should feel..."
- "The practice is the noticing" not "The goal is transcendence"

### Grounding Phase

**Purpose:** Safely return to ordinary awareness

**Key principles:**
- Never skip grounding
- Multi-sensory (touch, sight, sound, speech)
- Include deliberate naming (the opposite of the practice)
- "Wait until language feels normal" before moving on
- Useful number as cognitive anchor

### Evidence Notes

**Purpose:** Honest framing of the research basis

**Required in every protocol:**
- Deikman (1966) cited
- Semantic satiation research noted
- Mindfulness evidence referenced
- "Contemplative exploration" framing
- "Limited direct research" acknowledgment for specific exercises
- Cross-tradition parallels noted with attribution
