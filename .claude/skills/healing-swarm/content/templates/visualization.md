## Element Guidelines

### Preparation and Safety

**Always include:**
- Permission to stop at any time
- Grounding instructions if overwhelmed
- Statement that user is in control

**Example:**
```markdown
## Before You Begin

Find a quiet, comfortable space where you won't be disturbed.
Sit or lie in a position that supports your body.

*If at any point this feels too intense, you may open your eyes,
look around the room, and ground yourself by noticing:
5 things you can see
4 things you can touch
3 things you can hear

You are always in control of this experience.*
```

### Settling Phase

**Purpose:** Help the listener arrive and ground

**Include:**
- Breath awareness
- Body scan or release
- Transition from doing to being

**Pacing markers:**
- `...` = brief pause (2-3 seconds)
- `*Take a breath.*` = longer pause (5-10 seconds)
- `*Rest here for a moment.*` = extended pause (15-30 seconds)

**Example:**
```markdown
## Settling

*Begin by taking a slow breath in... and releasing.*

Notice where your body meets the surface beneath you.
Feel the support that holds you.

...

Let your shoulders soften.
Let your jaw release.
Let your eyes rest, closed or soft-focused.

...

*Take three slow breaths, each one allowing you to settle more deeply.*

In... and out...
In... and out...
In... and out...

*Let your breathing find its natural rhythm.*
```

### Opening the Journey

**Purpose:** Create the visualization space

**Approaches:**
- Direct scene-setting: "Imagine yourself in a garden..."
- Invitational: "Allow an image to arise..."
- Transitional: "With each breath, you find yourself..."

**Example:**
```markdown
## Opening

*With your next breath, allow an image to begin forming...*

You find yourself at the edge of a healing place.
Perhaps it's a garden... or a temple... or a quiet shore.
Let the image come as it will.

...

Notice what's around you in this place.
The colors... the quality of light...
Any sounds or silence...

*This is your healing space. It welcomes you.*
```

### The Journey

**Purpose:** The main visualization experience

**Guidelines:**
- Use present tense ("You are walking...")
- Multi-sensory ("see or sense," "feel or notice")
- Invitational language ("perhaps," "you might notice")
- Generous pauses for the listener's own imagery
- Natural sections or waypoints

**Sensory Inclusion:**
```markdown
*Multi-sensory cues:*

"Notice what you see... or sense... or simply know is there."
"Feel the warmth, or coolness, or tingling..."
"Perhaps you hear something... or simply feel the silence."
"There may be a scent... or simply fresh, clear air."
```

**Example:**
```markdown
## Journey

### Arriving

You walk slowly into this healing space.
With each step, you feel more present.

...

Notice the ground beneath your feet.
Is it soft? Firm? Cool or warm?

*Let the sensation ground you here.*

...

### Finding the Healing Place

Ahead, you notice a place that calls to you.
A place that seems to shimmer with possibility.

Move toward it at your own pace.

...

As you approach, you sense that this place holds
exactly what you need for healing.

*Take a breath as you arrive.*

...

### Receiving

You settle into this healing place.
Perhaps you sit... or lie down... or simply stand in its presence.

*Rest here, open to whatever wants to come.*

...
```

### Healing Moment

**Purpose:** The transformative center of the visualization

**Approaches:**
- Light imagery (healing light, color, warmth)
- Presence imagery (guide, angel, inner wisdom)
- Natural imagery (water, growth, restoration)
- Energetic imagery (flow, release, renewal)

**Important:**
- Invitational, not prescriptive
- Allow space for the user's own experience
- Don't promise specific outcomes

**Example:**
```markdown
## Healing Moment

*As you rest in this place, something begins to shift.*

A gentle light begins to gather around the part of you
that calls for healing.

Perhaps it has a color... perhaps it's simply luminous.
Let it be whatever it needs to be.

...

This light carries healing intention.
Not forcing. Not fixing.
Simply offering support to your body's own wisdom.

*Breathe with this light.*

...

Feel it moving where it needs to go.
Dissolving what needs to dissolve.
Restoring what wants to be restored.

*Rest here as long as you need.*

...

*There is nothing you need to do. Simply receive.*

...
```

### Integration

**Purpose:** Embody the experience before returning

**Include:**
- Invitation to notice what has shifted
- Body awareness
- Something to carry back

**Example:**
```markdown
## Integration

*Gently now, begin to notice your body.*

Feel what may have shifted.
There's nothing you need to name or understand.
Simply notice.

...

The healing you've invited is now held in your cells,
in your tissues, in the wisdom of your body.

*Take a breath to seal this in.*

...

If there's something from this place you want to bring back—
a color, a feeling, a knowing—
let it settle into your heart now.

...
```

### Return

**Purpose:** Gentle transition back to ordinary awareness

**Guidelines:**
- Gradual (not abrupt)
- Body-based
- Affirming

**Example:**
```markdown
## Return

*Begin now to return to this room, this moment.*

Feel the surface beneath you once again.
The weight of your body.
The air on your skin.

...

Wiggle your fingers and toes.
Take a slightly deeper breath.

...

*When you're ready—there's no rush—open your eyes.*

Let them rest on something nearby.
Let the colors of the room greet you.

*Welcome back.*
```

You might notice something blue, something with texture, something still.
You are here. You are safe. You are in control.*

# Healing Light for the Hands

**Duration:** 7 minutes
**Position:** Sitting comfortably, hands resting in lap
**Best for:** Before or after hand healing practices
**Intensity:** Gentle

---

## Before You Begin

Find a comfortable seat where your hands can rest naturally.
If one hand is injured, let it be supported comfortably.

*If at any point this feels too intense, open your eyes and look
around the room. You are always in control.*

---

## Settling

*Close your eyes, or soften your gaze.*

Take a slow breath in... and release.

...

Notice your hands resting in your lap.
Feel their weight. Their warmth or coolness.

...

*Take three slow breaths, letting each one settle you more deeply.*

...

---

## Opening

*With your next breath, imagine a soft, healing light
beginning to gather above your hands.*

Perhaps it has a color—green, gold, or simply luminous.
Let it be whatever it wants to be.

...

---

## Healing

*This light begins to descend, gently surrounding your hands.*

Feel its warmth, or coolness, or tingling presence.
It asks nothing of you. It simply offers support.

...

Let the light move where it's needed.
Through skin... through muscle... through tendon and bone.

*Breathe with the light.*

...

If there's tension, let the light soften it.
If there's pain, let the light hold it gently.
If there's healing in progress, let the light support it.

*Rest here.*

...

---

## Integration

*Notice what you feel in your hands now.*

There's nothing to name or understand.
Simply notice.

...

The light is now part of your hands.
It will continue its work, even after you return.

*Take a breath to seal this in.*

...

---

## Return

*Begin to feel the room around you.*

The surface beneath you. The air on your skin.

Wiggle your fingers gently—only as much as feels right.

...

*When you're ready, open your eyes.*

Let them rest on your hands.
Thank them for carrying you through life.

*Welcome back.*

---

## After the Visualization

Notice how your hands feel now compared to before.
You might gently move them, or simply let them rest.

If you wish, take a moment to journal about what you experienced.

---

*This visualization draws on healing light imagery common across
many traditions. It is offered as a complement to, not replacement
for, appropriate medical care for your hands.*
