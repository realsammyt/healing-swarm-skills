## Tradition Attribution

[Name the tradition of origin with specificity. Include dates, primary
sources, and any adaptations made from the traditional form.]

**Example:**
> This practice is adapted from qigong (氣功, "energy cultivation"),
> a system of movement, breathing, and meditation from Traditional
> Chinese Medicine with roots in texts dating to approximately 300 BCE.
> Qigong encompasses hundreds of distinct forms developed across
> millennia. We honor the lineages that have preserved and transmitted
> these practices. Our adaptation simplifies traditional forms for
> accessibility while maintaining core principles of breath-movement
> coordination and *qi* cultivation.

## Safety — Read Before Every Session

### Movement Safety
- Move **within comfort — NEVER through pain**
- If any movement causes pain, **reduce the range or skip it entirely**
- You can always **rest** — stopping is smart, not failure
- **Modify freely** — every body is different
- Stay **hydrated** — have water accessible
- If you feel **dizzy when standing**, sit down immediately

### Space and Equipment
- Clear enough space to extend your arms in all directions
  (for standing practice)
- Non-slip surface (bare feet or non-slip shoes recommended
  for standing)
- Chair with firm seat and no wheels (for seated practice)
- Mat or comfortable surface (for lying down practice)
- [Any specific equipment for this practice]

### Contraindications — Consult Your Healthcare Provider If You Have:
- Recent surgery (movement clearance needed)
- Acute injury or inflammation
- Severe osteoporosis
- Uncontrolled cardiovascular condition
- Acute disc herniation
- Balance disorders (practice seated or with support)
- Pregnancy (modifications required — no prone, no deep twists)
- Active joint infection or severe inflammatory flare
- Any condition your healthcare provider has advised against
  gentle movement

### Stop Immediately If You Experience:
- Sharp or shooting pain
- Joint locking or giving way
- Sudden swelling
- Numbness or tingling that doesn't resolve within a minute
- Chest pain or severe shortness of breath
- Dizziness that doesn't resolve when seated
- Loss of balance or near-fall

*If you have any medical conditions, consult your healthcare provider
before beginning this practice.*

## Before You Begin

### Space and Equipment
- [Specific space requirements for this practice]
- [Equipment list — most practices require none]
- Water nearby
- Timer or app (optional)

### Position Selection

Choose the position that serves you today. You can change at any time.

| Position | Setup |
|----------|-------|
| **Standing** | Feet hip-width apart, knees soft (not locked), arms at sides |
| **Seated (chair)** | Sit toward front of chair, feet flat on floor, spine upright but not rigid |
| **Seated (floor)** | Cross-legged or kneeling on cushion, spine upright |
| **Lying down** | On your back, legs extended or knees bent, arms at sides |
| **Wheelchair** | Wheels locked, feet on footrests or floor, sitting as upright as comfortable |

### Preparation
1. Choose your position
2. Take 3 natural breaths to settle
3. Brief body scan: notice how your body feels right now —
   areas of tension, ease, numbness, sensation
4. Set an intention if you wish (optional)
5. Remind yourself: move within comfort, never through pain

---

## The Practice

### Body Scan Check-In (2 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Scan through your body to notice how you feel before moving.

**How to do it:**
1. Close your eyes or soften your gaze
2. Notice your feet (or wherever your body contacts the surface)
3. Slowly move your attention upward: ankles, calves, knees, thighs
4. Hips, lower back, belly, chest
5. Shoulders, arms, hands
6. Neck, jaw, face, scalp
7. Notice: where feels tense? Where feels ease? Where feels numb?

**What you might notice:**
- Areas of tightness or holding
- Areas you barely feel (numbness or disconnection)
- Emotions connected to body sensations
- Or nothing particular — all is valid

*This check-in gives you a baseline. After the practice, you'll scan
again to notice what changed.*

---

### Warm-Up ([N] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Gently mobilize your joints and connect breath to movement.

**How to do it:**

**Movement 1: [Name]**

*Standing:*
[Detailed instruction]

*Seated:*
[Detailed adaptation]

*Lying down:*
[Detailed adaptation]

*Wheelchair:*
[Detailed adaptation]

**Breath coordination:** [How to sync breath with this movement]

**Body awareness cue:** [What to notice — "Feel the warmth in your
shoulders as they loosen"]

[Repeat for each warm-up movement]

**What you might notice:**
- Joints cracking or popping (generally normal for gentle movements)
- Warmth in the areas being moved
- Yawning or sighing (nervous system releasing)
- Movements becoming smoother as you continue

---

### Core Movement Sequence ([N] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
[Description of the core movement sequence]

**Movement 1: [Name] — [N breaths / N seconds]**

**What you'll do:**
[Brief description]

*Standing:*
1. [Step-by-step instruction]
2. [Body awareness cue]
3. [Breath coordination]

*Seated:*
1. [Adapted instruction]
2. [Body awareness cue]

*Lying down:*
1. [Adapted instruction]
2. [Body awareness cue]

*Wheelchair:*
1. [Adapted instruction]
2. [Body awareness cue]

**What you might notice:**
- [Expected sensation for this movement]

*Hold for [N] breaths, or as long as feels comfortable. There is no
minimum.*

---

**Movement 2: [Name] — [N breaths / N seconds]**

[Same structure as Movement 1, with all position modifications]

---

[Repeat for each movement in the sequence]

---

### Cool-Down / Integration ([N] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Gradually slow your movements and return to stillness.

**How to do it:**
1. Let your movements become smaller and slower
2. Come to stillness in your chosen position
3. Take 3 deep breaths
4. Body scan: notice how your body feels NOW compared to when
   you started
5. What changed? What softened? What feels different?

**What you might notice:**
- Areas that feel warmer, looser, or more alive
- Deep relaxation or pleasant fatigue
- Emotional tenderness or calm
- Greater awareness of your body's inner landscape

*Give yourself a moment in this stillness. The integration is part
of the practice.*

---

### Closing

**What you'll do:**
Ground yourself and transition back to daily activity.

**How to do it:**
1. Return to natural breathing
2. Feel the weight of your body on the surface beneath you
3. Wiggle your fingers and toes
4. If lying down: roll to one side before sitting up
5. If seated: place both feet firmly on the floor
6. If standing: feel your feet rooted on the ground
7. When ready, open your eyes
8. **If you were lying down or seated: stand up slowly**
9. Drink some water

**What you might notice:**
- Feeling more grounded or embodied
- Calm alertness
- Gentle fatigue (your body did real work)
- Or: nothing notable — all responses are valid

*Take a gentle moment before returning to activity. Your body just
did meaningful work — honor that with a soft transition.*

## Contraindications Detail

| Movement Type | Avoid If | Modify To |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Spinal flexion (forward bend) | Acute disc herniation, severe osteoporosis | Seated gentle lean, or skip |
| Spinal extension (backbend) | Spinal stenosis, acute back pain | Very small range, or skip |
| Twisting | Acute disc issue, pregnancy (deep twists) | Reduce range, keep pelvis stable |
| Weight-bearing | Acute fracture, severe joint inflammation | Seated or lying alternatives |
| Balance work | Vertigo, severe balance disorder | Wall support, or seated |
| Overhead reach | Shoulder impingement, rotator cuff injury | Below shoulder height, or skip |

*When in doubt, choose the gentler option. You can always do more
another day.*

---

## Variations

### If this feels too intense
- Reduce range of motion — smaller movements are valid
- Slow down — take twice as long for each movement
- Skip any movement that doesn't feel right
- Do the body scan only — awareness without movement is practice
- Shorten to 5-10 minutes

### If you want to deepen the practice
- Extend hold times (more breaths per position)
- Add movements from the [next level] progression
- Practice outdoors for grounding benefit
- Combine with breathwork before or after
- Extend total duration to 20-30 minutes

### For chronic pain
- Start with body scan only (non-movement)
- Micro-movements: smallest possible range of motion
- Focus on areas that feel good, not areas in pain
- End each session with something pleasant (gentle hand massage,
  warm cloth on shoulders)
- Shorter, more frequent sessions (5 minutes, 3x daily)

### For different times of day
- **Morning:** Slightly more vigorous warm-up, energizing
- **Midday:** 5-minute seated movement break — spinal, shoulders, wrists
- **Evening:** Gentler, slower, more floor-based — calming

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Suggestion |
|-------|------------|
| Pain during movement | Reduce range immediately. If pain persists, skip that movement entirely. Pain is a boundary, not a challenge |
| Can't balance on one leg | Use a wall, chair back, or counter for support. Or practice the movement seated. Balance builds over weeks |
| Feeling emotional during practice | Normal. Movement can release stored tension and emotion. Pause, ground yourself (feet on floor, name 5 things you see), then continue or stop — your choice |
| Joints cracking a lot | Generally normal for gentle movements. If accompanied by pain, reduce range. If persistent, mention to your healthcare provider |
| Too stiff to do the movements | Every range of motion is valid. Move 1 inch if that's what's available. Flexibility is not the goal — awareness is |
| Dizzy when standing up | Stand slowly. Pause halfway (hands on chair seat) before fully standing. This is common after lying or seated practice |
| Falling asleep during body scan | This means your body needs rest. Allow it. Or try seated rather than lying for the body scan |
| Don't feel anything | This is fine. Interoceptive awareness builds over time. Focus on the movement, not the sensation |

---

## Journal Prompt

After your practice, you might reflect on:

- How did your body feel before the practice? How does it feel now?
- Which movements felt most comfortable or enjoyable?
- Were there areas of your body you noticed for the first time?
- Did any emotions or memories surface during the practice?

*Journaling is optional. There is no requirement to report a particular
experience.*

---

## Building a Practice

**Frequency:** 3-5 times per week. Daily practice is ideal. Even 5
minutes counts. Consistency matters more than duration.

**Timeline:** Allow 1-2 weeks to learn the movements. Body awareness
and mobility typically improve noticeably within 3-4 weeks of regular
practice.

**Progression:**
- Week 1-2: Focus on body scan and warm-up movements
- Week 3-4: [Intermediate progression]
- Month 2+: [Advanced progression if applicable]
- Ongoing: Deepen awareness, expand range naturally, explore traditions

## Element Guidelines

### Safety Section

**Purpose:** Ensure physical safety before every session

**Requirements:**
- "Move within comfort, never through pain" — the cardinal rule
- Full contraindication list
- Red flag symptoms with stop instruction
- Space and equipment check
- Medical disclaimer

**This section must NEVER be shortened, softened, or made optional.**
Movement carries physical risk. The safety section protects users.

### Position Selection

**Purpose:** Ensure every practice is accessible to all abilities

**MANDATORY:** Every protocol must include ALL FOUR position options:
1. Standing
2. Seated (chair or wheelchair)
3. Lying down
4. Wheelchair-specific adaptations

**No exceptions.** If a movement cannot be adapted for a position,
state clearly: "For [position]: skip this movement and rest."

### Core Movement Section

**Purpose:** Guide the primary movement practice

**Key principles:**
- One movement per section (clear, not combined)
- All four position modifications per movement
- Breath coordination specified
- Body awareness cue included ("notice the warmth," "feel the stretch")
- Hold duration in breaths, not seconds (breath paces the practice)
- Permission to reduce or skip at every step

**Language:**
- "Explore how far feels comfortable" not "Reach as far as you can"
- "Notice the sensation" not "You should feel a deep stretch"
- "If this doesn't feel right, skip it" not "Push through the resistance"

### Evidence Notes

**Purpose:** Honest framing of the research basis

**Required in every protocol:**
- Tradition named with specificity and dates
- Key study citations with sample sizes
- "Studies suggest" not "science proves"
- Limitations noted
- Traditional use distinguished from clinical evidence
- Movement practice distinguished from medical treatment / physical therapy
