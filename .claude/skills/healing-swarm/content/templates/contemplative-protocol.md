## Before You Begin

### You'll Need
- [Duration] of uninterrupted time
- A quiet, comfortable space
- Seated position (chair, cushion, or floor)
- Optional: journal and pen for reflection afterwards
- A willingness to sit with questions without needing answers

### Important Safety Information

**Deep questioning about identity, suffering, and meaning can
temporarily change how you experience yourself and your situation.**
This is sometimes part of the contemplative process, but it should
not persist beyond the practice.

- **Mental health screening:** If you are currently experiencing
  severe depression, active psychosis, dissociative episodes, or
  suicidal thoughts, this practice is not appropriate for you at
  this time. Please seek support from a mental health professional.
- **Do not practice** if you are in acute mental health crisis,
  experiencing active dissociation, or recently traumatized without
  therapeutic support
- **Always have grounding available** (see Grounding section below)
- **Stop immediately** if you feel panicked, severely disoriented,
  or disconnected from reality in a way that frightens you
- These practices complement but do not replace mental health
  treatment or spiritual direction

*If this question feels destabilizing at any point, return to your
breath. You can stop at any time. Stopping is always a valid choice.*

### Grounding Anchor (Learn This First)

**Quick Grounding — memorize before starting:**
1. Open your eyes. Look at something specific and ordinary
2. Feel your feet on the floor, your body in the chair
3. Breathe: in for 4 counts through nose, out for 6 through mouth
4. Name 3 things you can see, 2 you can touch, 1 you can hear
5. Say your name, today's date, where you are

*This is your anchor. Use it whenever you need to return to
ordinary awareness. You can always return to the inquiry later.*

## The Practice

### Phase 1: Settling and Grounding (5 minutes)

*This settling phase is intentionally longer than in other practice
templates. Contemplative inquiry can be destabilizing, so we build
a strong foundation of physical and emotional groundedness first.*

**What you'll do:**
Arrive fully in your body and your present environment before
beginning any inquiry.

**How to do it:**
1. Sit comfortably. Feet flat on the floor. Hands resting in
   your lap or on your knees
2. Close your eyes partially or fully — whatever feels safe
3. Take 3 slow, natural breaths. Don't control them, just notice
4. Feel the weight of your body in the chair. The solidity of the
   floor beneath your feet
5. Scan your body briefly: head, shoulders, chest, belly, legs.
   Not changing anything — just arriving
6. Notice the temperature of the air. The sounds in the room.
   You are here, in this place, at this time
7. Run the grounding anchor once: name 3 things you see, 2 you
   can touch, 1 you can hear. Say your name quietly
8. Set a gentle intention: "I am going to sit with a question.
   I don't need to find an answer. I just need to be present"
9. Take 2 more slow breaths

**What you might notice:**
The mind may already be busy. Planning, worrying, narrating. This
is normal. You don't need to quiet the mind before beginning — the
inquiry itself will give it something to attend to.

*Duration: 5 minutes. Do not rush this phase.*

---

### Phase 2: Question Presentation ([X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Receive the inquiry question and let it settle into awareness.

**How to do it:**
1. [Present the question clearly, with brief context for why it
   matters]
2. Read or hear the question once. Let it land
3. Read or hear it a second time, more slowly
4. Don't immediately try to answer it. Just sit with it as a
   question — a genuine wondering
5. [If applicable: context for the question's traditional or
   therapeutic significance]

**What you might notice:**
- The mind may jump immediately to an answer. That's fine — notice
  the answer, then return to the question itself
- The question may feel too big, or too simple, or confusing. All
  of these responses are informative
- You may feel something in your body — tightness, opening, warmth.
  That is part of the inquiry

*If the question feels overwhelming, return to your breath. You
can engage with it more gently, or set it down entirely.*

---

### Phase 3: Sitting With the Question ([X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Hold the question in awareness without trying to answer it. Let
the inquiry work on its own.

**How to do it:**
1. Let the question rest in your awareness like an object you're
   looking at from different angles — not solving, just regarding
2. When answers arise (and they will), notice them gently. You
   can acknowledge them: "That's one response." Then return to
   the question
3. Notice what happens in your body as you sit with the question.
   Where do you feel it? What sensations arise?
4. Notice what emotions surface. Curiosity? Frustration? Sadness?
   Peace? Nothing particular? All are valid
5. If the mind wanders completely, gently bring it back to the
   question. No judgment — wandering and returning IS the practice
6. [If applicable: additional prompts or sub-questions to deepen]

**What you might notice:**
- Layers of answers — superficial ones first, then deeper ones
- Silence — periods where no answer comes. This is valuable. Stay
  with the silence
- Emotional responses that surprise you
- Physical sensations — the body has its own responses to questions
- The question itself shifting or changing shape
- Nothing in particular — subtlety is normal in contemplative work

*If at any point you feel destabilized, frightened, or disconnected
from reality, use the grounding anchor immediately. You can return
to the inquiry another day.*

*Duration: [X] minutes*

---

### Phase 4: Noticing Responses ([X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Shift from holding the question to observing what the inquiry has
surfaced.

**How to do it:**
1. Gently release the question. Let it dissolve for now
2. What remains? What has the inquiry left in its wake?
3. Notice any thoughts that feel different from your usual thinking
4. Notice any emotional tone — has something shifted, however subtly?
5. Notice your body. Has anything changed in how you feel physically?
6. [If applicable: specific prompts for this inquiry type]
7. You don't need to evaluate or make sense of anything yet. Just
   notice what is present

*Duration: [X] minutes*

---

### Phase 5: Deepening (Optional — [X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
If the inquiry has opened something and you feel stable, follow
the thread deeper.

**How to do it:**
1. Is there a follow-up question that arises naturally? Not one
   you construct, but one that presents itself?
2. If so, hold it gently — the same way you held the original
   question
3. If not, simply rest in the awareness that remains after inquiry
4. [If applicable: suggested deepening questions specific to this
   practice]

**Important:** Skip this phase entirely if:
- You feel even slightly destabilized
- You're tired or distracted
- Nothing particular is arising (that's completely fine)
- This is your first time with this practice

*Duration: [X] minutes, or skip*

---

### Phase 6: Integration ([X] minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Acknowledge what the inquiry has revealed (or not revealed) and
begin to reconnect with ordinary awareness.

**How to do it:**
1. Take a moment to simply acknowledge: "I sat with a question.
   This is what happened." No evaluation needed
2. If something shifted — a new perspective, a feeling, a
   recognition — let it settle. You don't need to do anything
   with it yet
3. If nothing shifted, acknowledge that too. Not every inquiry
   session produces visible results. The work is often underground
4. [If applicable: integration-specific prompts]
5. Begin to shift your attention outward: sounds in the room,
   light, temperature

*Duration: [X] minutes*

---

### Phase 7: Grounding and Return (5 minutes)

*This return phase is intentionally thorough. After contemplative
inquiry, it is important to fully re-engage with ordinary, embodied,
present-moment awareness before continuing your day.*

**What you'll do:**
Return completely to ordinary, grounded awareness.

**How to do it:**
1. Let the inquiry dissolve completely. You can return to it later
2. Place both feet flat on the floor. Press gently. Feel the ground
3. Put one hand on your chest, one on your belly. Breathe naturally
   for 5 breaths
4. Open your eyes fully. Look around the room deliberately
5. Name 5 things you see — out loud if possible
6. Touch something nearby — notice its texture, temperature
7. Say your name, today's date, and where you are
8. Wiggle your fingers and toes. Stretch gently
9. Have a sip of water if available
10. Wait until your sense of self and surroundings feels stable
    and normal before standing

**What you might notice:**
- A sense of freshness or unfamiliarity — perception may feel
  slightly different after inquiry. This typically normalizes
  within minutes
- Tiredness — contemplative inquiry uses real cognitive energy
- Emotional tenderness — questions about healing and suffering
  can leave you feeling open
- Or nothing particular — also completely normal

*Take a full 2-3 minutes after grounding before moving on with
your day. Do something simple and physical: wash your hands,
stretch, take a short walk.*

---

## Reflection (Optional)

If you'd like to record your experience, consider these prompts:

- What happened when I sat with the question?
- Did any answers arise? Were any of them surprising?
- What did I notice in my body during the inquiry?
- What, if anything, feels different now?
- Is there a follow-up question I'd like to sit with next time?
- [Practice-specific reflection prompts]

*Journaling is not required. Some people process inquiry through
writing; others through movement, conversation, or simply living.
Find what works for you.*

## When to Seek a Teacher

Some inquiry traditions are best practiced with trained guidance.
Consider seeking a teacher or counselor if:

- You find contemplative inquiry deeply meaningful and want to
  go further in a specific tradition (Zen, Advaita, Ignatian)
- Questions about identity or existence are arising with intensity
  that feels beyond self-guided practice
- You want to work with traditional koans or advanced self-inquiry
- You are processing significant grief, trauma, or life transition
  through inquiry and would benefit from accompaniment
- The practices consistently surface material you don't know how
  to integrate

**Where to look:**
- Zen centers and sanghas (for koan-based inquiry)
- Vedanta societies and Advaita teachers (for self-inquiry)
- Ignatian retreat centers (for Examen and discernment)
- Philosophical counseling practitioners (APPA, NPCA directories)
- Psychotherapists trained in ACT or existential therapy
- Interfaith spiritual directors

---

## Contraindications

**Do not practice this inquiry if you are currently experiencing:**
- Active psychosis or psychotic features
- Severe depression without therapeutic support
- Active dissociative disorders
- Severe depersonalization/derealization
- Active suicidal ideation
- Acute trauma response
- Mania or hypomania

**Use with caution and shorter sessions if you have:**
- History of dissociative experiences
- History of adverse meditation experiences
- Anxiety disorders (start with structured reflection only)
- Ongoing grief process (Level 1 only, with gentle questions)

*If you have any mental health conditions, consult your provider
before beginning practices that involve deep self-questioning.*

---

## Variations

### If this feels too intense
- Shorten the inquiry phase to 2-3 minutes
- Stay with Level 1 (Structured Reflection) questions only
- Keep your eyes open throughout
- Focus primarily on the settling and grounding phases
- Practice with a trusted friend nearby

### If nothing seems to happen
- This is normal and valuable — subtlety is the nature of inquiry
- Try the same question on a different day
- Write your responses instead of sitting silently
- "Nothing happened" may itself be worth investigating gently

### If you want to go deeper
- Extend the sitting-with-the-question phase
- Return to the same question across multiple sessions
- Try the deepening phase (Phase 5) if you feel stable
- Consider seeking a teacher in the relevant tradition

### For different times of day
- **Morning:** Fresh mind, shorter practice, questions about intention
- **Midday:** Brief structured reflection, questions about what you've noticed
- **Evening:** Ignatian-style review of the day, integration questions

---

## Building a Practice

**Frequency:** 2-3 times per week. Daily is fine at Level 1.
Quality of attention matters more than frequency.

**Duration:** Start with 15-minute sessions (5 settling, 5 inquiry,
5 grounding). Increase only when the current duration feels
stable and manageable.

**Progression:**
- Weeks 1-3: Structured Reflection (Level 1) — bounded questions,
  journaling, daily review
- Weeks 4-6: Guided Questioning (Level 2) — examining assumptions,
  cognitive defusion
- Weeks 7+: Open Inquiry (Level 3) — only when Levels 1-2 feel
  stable and grounding is automatic
- Month 3+: Silent Investigation (Level 4) — only with established
  practice and ideally teacher support

*There is no pressure to advance. Many people practice at Level 1-2
for years with profound benefit.*

## Background

### About Contemplative Inquiry

Inquiry-based contemplative practice appears across the world's
wisdom traditions. The common thread is the recognition that
asking questions with sustained attention — rather than seeking
quick answers — can reveal assumptions, dissolve fixed beliefs,
and open new perspectives on suffering and healing.

### Cross-Tradition Parallels

- **Zen Buddhism** (Rinzai, 12th century) — Koan practice uses
  paradoxical questions to bypass conceptual thinking and
  precipitate direct insight (*kensho*)
- **Advaita Vedanta** (Ramana Maharshi, 20th century) — "Who am I?"
  (*vichara*) investigates the nature of the self that experiences
- **Socratic Method** (5th century BCE) — Systematic questioning
  reveals unexamined beliefs (*elenchus*)
- **Ignatian Spirituality** (16th century) — The Daily Examen
  uses structured reflection for discernment and integration
- **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy** (Hayes, 1999) — Cognitive
  defusion observes thoughts as mental events, not facts
- **Dzogchen** (Tibetan) — REFERENCE ONLY (closed tradition) —
  "pointing-out" instructions as direct investigation of mind

*We honor each tradition's distinct context. The practices here
are modern adaptations drawing on shared principles of inquiry.*

### Key Research

- **Wells A (2009)** — Metacognitive therapy: treating thinking
  about thinking. Evidence for questioning cognitive patterns.
- **Hayes SC et al. (1999)** — Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.
  Cognitive defusion as therapeutic questioning.
  Strong evidence base (multiple RCTs, meta-analyses).
- **Lahav R (2016)** — Philosophical counseling outcomes.
  Preliminary evidence for philosophy-based dialogue.
- **Barbezat DP, Bush M (2014)** — Contemplative pedagogy in
  higher education. Preliminary evidence for inquiry practices
  in wellbeing.

*Note: Direct research on the specific inquiry protocols in this
template is limited. The practices draw on well-established
contemplative and therapeutic principles with varying levels
of clinical evidence.*

---

*This practice complements but does not replace medical or
psychological care. If you have any mental health conditions,
consult your provider before beginning practices that involve
deep self-questioning or investigation of identity and suffering.*

## Element Guidelines

### Safety Section

**Purpose:** Ensure psychological safety before every inquiry practice

**Requirements:**
- Mental health screening note (depression, psychosis, dissociation, suicidality)
- Contraindication list (more extensive than other templates)
- Grounding protocol taught before practice
- Permission to stop — at EVERY phase
- Mental health professional referral language
- "Not a replacement for treatment" disclaimer
- "If this question feels destabilizing, return to your breath" — present at every phase

**This section must NEVER be shortened or softened.**
Contemplative inquiry can precipitate existential crisis. The safety
section is the most important part of every protocol.

### Settling Phase

**Purpose:** Build a foundation of groundedness before any questioning

**Key principles:**
- 5 minutes MINIMUM — more than other practice templates
- Body-based grounding (feet on floor, breath, sensory awareness)
- Run grounding anchor once before inquiry begins
- Set gentle intention: inquiry, not interrogation
- This phase is NOT optional — it is structural

**Why longer:** Inquiry works with identity and meaning. These are
more destabilizing domains than body awareness or breath. The
practitioner needs to be well-grounded before entering the question.

### Core Inquiry Phase

**Purpose:** Guide the contemplative investigation

**Key principles:**
- One question at a time
- Present the question, then create space — don't fill with words
- Include what to do when answers arise (notice, don't attach)
- Include what to do when nothing arises (that is also the practice)
- Include what to do when it feels too intense (grounding, exit)
- No target experiences, insights, or outcomes
- Exit ramp at every stage

**Language:**
- "Notice what arises when you ask..." not "You will discover..."
- "Sit with the question" not "Solve the question"
- "Some people find..." not "You should experience..."
- "The practice is the questioning itself" not "The goal is the answer"

### Grounding and Return Phase

**Purpose:** Safely return to ordinary, stable, embodied awareness

**Key principles:**
- 5 minutes MINIMUM — as long as the settling phase
- Never skip grounding
- Multi-sensory (touch, sight, sound, speech)
- Include deliberate naming (grounding through language)
- Include physical anchors (feet on floor, hands on body)
- "Wait until your sense of self feels stable" before moving on
- Suggest post-practice physical activity (walk, water, stretch)
- More thorough than other practice templates — inquiry can leave
  practitioners in a liminal state

### Evidence Notes

**Purpose:** Honest framing of the research basis

**Required in every protocol:**
- ACT/cognitive defusion research cited (strong evidence base)
- Metacognitive therapy referenced (Wells, 2009)
- Philosophical counseling noted (preliminary)
- Contemplative pedagogy referenced (preliminary)
- "Contemplative exploration" framing
- "Limited direct research" acknowledgment for specific exercises
- Cross-tradition parallels noted with attribution

### When to Seek a Teacher Section

**Purpose:** Acknowledge that some inquiry traditions benefit from
trained guidance, and provide direction for interested practitioners

**Required in every protocol:**
- Specific recommendations based on inquiry type
- Recognition that advanced inquiry may need accompaniment
- Practical guidance: where to find teachers/counselors
- Not discouraging — empowering; supporting the user's autonomy

---
