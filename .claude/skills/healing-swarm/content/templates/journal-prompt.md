## Structure

```markdown
## Journal Prompt

### [Theme or Title]
*[Context for this reflection - e.g., Day 3, After visualization, etc.]*

---

**Today's Reflection:**

[Main prompt question - clear, open-ended, invitational]

---

**If helpful, consider:**

- [Guiding question 1]
- [Guiding question 2]
- [Guiding question 3]

---

**Remember:**

There are no right answers. Write what's true for you.
You don't have to share this with anyone.
Even a few words are enough.

---

*[Optional: Brief context for why this reflection might be valuable]*
```

---

## Prompt Types

### 1. Body Awareness Prompts

**Purpose:** Deepen connection with physical experience

**Example:**
```markdown
## Journal Prompt

### Listening to Your Body
*After today's practice*

---

**Today's Reflection:**

If your body could speak today, what would it say to you?

---

**If helpful, consider:**

- What sensations are present right now?
- Is there a message in what you're feeling?
- What does your body need that it hasn't received?

---

**Remember:**

There are no right answers. Write what's true for you.
Your body's wisdom doesn't always use words.
Even a few words or a drawing are enough.
```

### 2. Healing Journey Prompts

**Purpose:** Process the healing experience

**Example:**
```markdown
## Journal Prompt

### The Shape of Healing
*Day 7 of your journey*

---

**Today's Reflection:**

If your healing journey were a landscape, what would it look like right now?

---

**If helpful, consider:**

- Are you climbing, descending, resting, or lost?
- What's the terrain like—rocky, smooth, overgrown?
- Can you see where you're going, or is it unclear?
- Who or what is traveling with you?

---

**Remember:**

There are no right answers. Write what's true for you.
Healing is rarely a straight path.
Wherever you are is exactly where you need to be.
```

### 3. Gratitude Prompts

**Purpose:** Cultivate appreciation and positive focus

**Example:**
```markdown
## Journal Prompt

### Small Graces
*Evening reflection*

---

**Today's Reflection:**

What small thing are you grateful for today—something easy to overlook?

---

**If helpful, consider:**

- A moment of comfort or relief
- Something your body could do today
- A kindness you received or gave
- Something in your environment that supported you

---

**Remember:**

There are no right answers. Write what's true for you.
Gratitude doesn't mean ignoring pain.
Both can exist at once.
```

### 4. Emotion Processing Prompts

**Purpose:** Create space for emotional experience

**Example:**
```markdown
## Journal Prompt

### What's Here Now
*Open reflection*

---

**Today's Reflection:**

What emotion keeps visiting you lately? What might it be trying to tell you?

---

**If helpful, consider:**

- When does this feeling show up most?
- Where do you feel it in your body?
- What happens if you simply let it be here?
- What does it need from you?

---

**Remember:**

There are no right answers. Write what's true for you.
Emotions are information, not problems to solve.
You don't have to fix anything—just notice.

---

*If difficult emotions arise, you may want to use a grounding practice
afterward, or reach out to a supportive person.*
```

### 5. Hope and Intention Prompts

**Purpose:** Connect with future possibilities

**Example:**
```markdown
## Journal Prompt

### A Letter to Your Future Self
*Setting intentions*

---

**Today's Reflection:**

Write a few words to yourself three months from now.
What do you want future-you to remember about this time?

---

**If helpful, consider:**

- What are you learning that you don't want to forget?
- What hope or intention do you want to carry forward?
- What would you want to tell yourself on a hard day?

---

**Remember:**

There are no right answers. Write what's true for you.
You don't have to be certain about the future.
Intention matters more than prediction.
```

### 6. Practice Reflection Prompts

**Purpose:** Integrate insights from practices

**Example:**
```markdown
## Journal Prompt

### After the Practice
*Post-practice reflection*

---

**Today's Reflection:**

What, if anything, shifted during today's practice?

---

**If helpful, consider:**

- What did you notice in your body?
- Did any thoughts or images arise?
- How do you feel now compared to before?
- Is there something to remember or carry forward?

---

**Remember:**

There are no right answers. Write what's true for you.
"Nothing" is also a valid answer.
Not every practice produces obvious shifts—and that's okay.
```

### 7. Compassion Prompts

**Purpose:** Cultivate self-kindness

**Example:**
```markdown
## Journal Prompt

### Words You Need to Hear
*Self-compassion reflection*

---

**Today's Reflection:**

What do you most need to hear today?
Write it here, as if a loving friend were saying it to you.

---

**If helpful, consider:**

- What would you say to a friend in your situation?
- What words would comfort the part of you that's struggling?
- What truth about yourself do you sometimes forget?

---

**Remember:**

There are no right answers. Write what's true for you.
Speaking kindly to yourself isn't selfish.
You deserve the compassion you give others.
```

---

## Writing Guidelines

### Prompt Qualities

**Good prompts are:**
- Open-ended (no yes/no answers)
- Invitational (not demanding)
- Specific enough to spark reflection
- Broad enough to allow personal interpretation
- Non-judgmental in framing

**Example of transformation:**

| Weak Prompt | Strong Prompt |
|-------------|---------------|
| "What are you grateful for?" | "What small thing are you grateful for today—something easy to overlook?" |
| "How do you feel?" | "If you could name what you're feeling with a color or weather, what would it be?" |
| "Write about your progress" | "What's one way you've grown that you haven't acknowledged yet?" |
| "What are your goals?" | "What would 'healed' look like for you? Not perfectly—just enough." |

### Avoid These

- Leading questions ("Don't you feel better now?")
- Shame-inducing prompts ("Why haven't you been more consistent?")
- Performance pressure ("Describe your spiritual breakthrough")
- Overly complex prompts (multiple questions in one)
- Prompts assuming specific outcomes ("Describe your pain reduction")

### Tone

- Warm but not saccharine
- Curious but not probing
- Supportive but not patronizing
- Simple but not simplistic

---

## Guiding Questions

### Purpose

Help users who feel stuck or want more direction without being prescriptive

### Guidelines

- Offer 2-4 sub-questions
- Each should approach the main prompt from a different angle
- Use varied entry points (body, mind, metaphor, memory)
- All should be optional ("If helpful...")

### Examples by Angle

**Body-based:**
- "Where do you feel this in your body?"
- "What physical sensations are present?"

**Metaphor-based:**
- "If this feeling were weather, what would it be?"
- "What landscape does this experience remind you of?"

**Memory-based:**
- "When have you felt this way before?"
- "What past experience does this echo?"

**Relational:**
- "Who would understand what you're experiencing?"
- "What would you want someone to know about this?"

**Forward-looking:**
- "What would shift if this resolved?"
- "What's one small thing that might help?"

## Safety Considerations

### For Emotional Prompts

Include grounding reminder:
```markdown
*If difficult emotions arise, you may want to use a grounding practice
afterward, or reach out to a supportive person.*
```

### For Challenging Themes

Provide exit ramp:
```markdown
*If this prompt doesn't feel right today, you may skip it or write
about something else that wants attention.*
```

### For All Prompts

Include permission:
```markdown
**Remember:**
There are no right answers. Write what's true for you.
You don't have to share this with anyone.
Even a few words are enough.
```

---

## Prompt Sequences

### For Multi-Day Journeys

Prompts can build on each other:

**Day 1:** What brings you to this healing journey?
**Day 3:** What's surprised you so far?
**Day 7:** What's shifting, even slightly?
**Day 14:** What are you learning about yourself?
**Day 21:** What do you want to carry forward?

### For Post-Practice Reflection

**After visualization:** What images or feelings stayed with you?
**After body practice:** What does your body want you to know?
**After prayer:** What arose in the silence?

### Meeting Your Healing
*Day 10 of the journey*

---

**Today's Reflection:**

If your healing could take any form—a person, an animal, a force of
nature, anything at all—what would it be? What does it look like?
What does it want you to know?

---

**If helpful, consider:**

- What qualities does this form embody?
- How does it approach you—gently, playfully, seriously?
- Is there something it wants to give you, or show you?
- What happens if you let yourself receive it?

---

**Remember:**

There are no right answers. Write what's true for you.
The image that comes is the right image.
You don't have to understand it—just receive it.

---

*This kind of reflective imagery can help connect with the healing
process in a way that goes beyond the analytical mind. Let yourself
play with the image that arises.*
```
