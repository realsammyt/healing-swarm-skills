## Voice and Tone

### For Different Content Types

| Content Type | Tone | Example |
|--------------|------|---------|
| Prayer | Reverent, spacious | "In this moment, we pause..." |
| Evidence | Clear, honest | "Studies suggest that..." |
| Instructions | Warm, precise | "Place your hand gently..." |
| Visualizations | Immersive, sensory | "Notice the warmth spreading..." |
| Journal prompts | Invitational, open | "What arises when you consider..." |
| Historical notes | Scholarly, accessible | "This practice originated in..." |

### Language Patterns

**DO use:**
- "You might notice..." (invitational)
- "This may support..." (honest about outcomes)
- "Traditionally understood as..." (attribution)
- "When you're ready..." (respects pace)
- "If this feels right for you..." (honors autonomy)

**DON'T use:**
- "You will feel..." (prescriptive)
- "This will heal..." (overclaiming)
- "Ancient secrets..." (sensationalized)
- "You must..." (controlling)
- "Obviously..." (condescending)

---

## Accessibility Guidelines

### Reading Level

- Target 8th grade reading level for general content
- Define technical terms on first use
- Short sentences for instructions
- Longer, flowing sentences for immersive content

### Inclusive Language

- Person-first: "person with injury" not "injured person"
- Ability-neutral: Offer modifications without othering
- Belief-neutral: Invitational, not assuming shared beliefs
- Culturally aware: Proper attribution, no appropriation

### Sensory Inclusion

For visualizations and instructions, include multiple sensory channels:

```
✓ "Notice what you see, or sense, or simply know is there..."
✓ "You might feel warmth, or tingling, or simply presence..."
✓ "Listen, or feel, or simply be aware of..."

✗ "See the bright white light..." (excludes non-visual processors)
```

## Ethics in Content

### Medical Disclaimer Integration

Every content piece that describes a practice should include:

```markdown
---
*This practice complements but does not replace medical care.
Continue all prescribed treatments. Consult your healthcare provider
before beginning any new health practice.*
---
```

### Evidence Language

Match language to evidence level (from Clinical Researcher):

| Evidence Level | Use This Phrase |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Strong | "Research demonstrates..." |
| Moderate | "Studies suggest..." |
| Preliminary | "Early research indicates..." |
| Traditional only | "Traditionally used for..." |

### Attribution Requirements

All traditional content must include:

1. Tradition of origin
2. Time period/era
3. Primary source (if available)
4. Note on adaptations made
5. Acknowledgment of lineage holders
