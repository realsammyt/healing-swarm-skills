## Cross-Cultural Energy Concepts

### Vital Energy Terms

| Tradition | Original Term | Transliteration | Our Standard Usage |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Chinese | 氣 | Qi (Chi) | "vital energy" or "*qi*" |
| Sanskrit | प्राण | Prana | "vital energy" or "*prana*" |
| Hebrew | רוח | Ruach | "breath/spirit" or "*ruach*" |
| Greek | πνεῦμα | Pneuma | "breath/spirit" or "*pneuma*" |
| Japanese | 気 | Ki | "vital energy" or "*ki*" |
| Tibetan | རླུང | Lung (rLung) | "wind/energy" or "*lung*" |
| Hawaiian | - | Mana | "life force" or "*mana*" |

**Formatting:** Italicize non-English terms on first use: *qi*, *prana*

**Standard bridging phrase:**
> "What Traditional Chinese Medicine calls *qi*, Vedic traditions call *prana*,
> and Hebrew mysticism calls *ruach*—different cultural lenses on the vital
> energy that animates living systems."

**Important:** These terms are NOT exact equivalents. Note differences when relevant:
- *Qi* has material aspects (blood, fluids) that *prana* does not emphasize
- *Ruach* has theological dimensions not present in *qi*
- Use parallel structure for accessibility while acknowledging distinctions

## Consciousness Research Terminology (Grinberg)

> Terms from the consciousness research of Dr. Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum
> (1946–1994), Mexican neurophysiologist at UNAM. All terms require explicit
> evidence-level labeling when used in content.

### Core Theoretical Concepts

| Term | Definition | Evidence Status |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| Syntergic Theory | Brain creates a hypercomplex neuronal field (*campo neuronal*) that interacts with an underlying conscious substrate | Theoretical framework |
| The Lattice (*la lattice*) | Non-local holographic matrix of consciousness underlying reality; the substrate that neuronal fields interact with | Theoretical (not empirically verified) |
| Self-Allusive Meditation | Simultaneous awareness of bodily, emotional, mental, and external fields; Grinberg's meditative protocol | Practice with preliminary research |
| Interhemispheric Coherence | Synchronization of neural activity between brain hemispheres, measured via EEG; enhanced by meditation | Research-supported (small samples) |
| Transferred Potential | Correlated evoked potentials observed in separated meditation partners (~25% response rate across 50+ experiments) | Preliminary (limited independent replication) |
| Consciousness Orbitals | Discrete levels of awareness: bodily → emotional → mental → transpersonal → unity | Theoretical model |
| Neural Synergy (*sintergia*) | Integrated coherent brain activity in meditative states; the brain functioning as unified field | Research-supported (EEG studies) |
| High-Inclusion Neuro Algorithms | Cognitive patterns enabling simultaneous multi-domain awareness; the neural correlate of self-allusive meditation | Theoretical |

### Practice Mode Terms (Grinberg)

| Mode | Description | Standard Term |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Self-allusive practice | Individual interhemispheric coherence practice | "Coherence meditation" |
| Transferred potential pairing | Two practitioners meditating together then separating | "Resonance pairing" |
| Orbital progression | Multi-day journey through consciousness levels | "Orbital journey" |
| Lattice connection | Advanced practice of sensing the underlying field | "Field awareness practice" |

### Usage Guidelines

**Formatting:** Italicize Grinberg-specific terms on first use: *syntergic theory*, *the Lattice*

**Required context when referencing Grinberg's work:**
> "Dr. Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum (1946–1994) was a Mexican neurophysiologist
> at UNAM who studied consciousness, meditation, and traditional healing.
> His research program ended with his disappearance in 1994."

**Evidence labeling:** ALWAYS pair Grinberg terms with their evidence status:
- "Grinberg's *syntergic theory* (a theoretical framework, not empirically verified)..."
- "Preliminary EEG studies suggest interhemispheric coherence increases during meditation (small sample sizes, limited replication)..."
- "The *transferred potential* phenomenon (~25% response rate in Grinberg's lab; limited independent replication)..."

**Cultural context:** Grinberg worked extensively with Mexican Indigenous healers,
particularly the healer known as Pachita. When referencing this work:
- Acknowledge Grinberg as researcher/observer, not tradition holder
- Respect Indigenous healing as living, owned tradition
- Do not reproduce specific ceremonial practices without community permission
- Use "Grinberg documented..." not "Grinberg discovered..."

### Cross-Reference with Existing Traditions

| Grinberg Concept | TCM Parallel | Vedic Parallel | Western Parallel |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| The Lattice | Tao (道) | Brahman | Universal consciousness |
| Neuronal field | Wei Qi field | Pranamaya kosha | Biofield |
| Self-allusive awareness | Wuji standing meditation | Dharana/Dhyana | Mindfulness |
| Consciousness orbitals | — | Koshas/Chakra levels | Wilber's spectrum |
| Interhemispheric coherence | Yin-yang balance | Ida-pingala balance | Hemispheric synchronization |

**Note:** These parallels are suggestive, not equivalences. Each framework has
distinct epistemological foundations and should be presented on its own terms.
