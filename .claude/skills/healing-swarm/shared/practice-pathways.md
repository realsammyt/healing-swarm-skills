# Healing Swarm Practice Pathways

> This guide maps the relationships between healing practices and provides
> structured progressions for different user needs. All pathways honor the
> principle that the user is the healer — we provide options, not prescriptions.

---

## Core Principle

**"Every healing journey is unique. Pathways are maps, not mandates."**

These progressions are suggestions based on complementary mechanisms of action
and traditional practice combinations. Users should be encouraged to adapt,
skip, revisit, and customize. No pathway is the "right" one.

### Complementary Pairs

| Practice A | Practice B | Why They Complement |
|------------|------------|---------------------|
| Breathwork | Cold exposure | Breathwork builds nervous system capacity that supports cold adaptation |
| Breathwork | Meditation | Breath awareness bridges active breathwork and passive meditation |
| Cold exposure | Movement | Cold activates systems that movement then helps regulate |
| Meditation | Transpersonal | Meditation builds the attentional stability needed for transpersonal exploration |
| Movement | Meditation | Embodied awareness from movement deepens meditation; meditation deepens body awareness |
| Sound healing | Meditation | Sound provides an anchor for attention; meditation deepens receptivity to sound |
| Paired practice | Solo meditation | Solo stability makes paired resonance safer and more sustainable |

### Sequential Dependencies

Some practices are best introduced after others are established:

| Foundation Practice | Build To | Minimum Foundation Period |
|---------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| Basic breath awareness | WHM breathwork | 2 weeks of daily breath observation |
| Room-temperature water exposure | Cold immersion | 2 weeks of gradual temperature reduction |
| 10-minute guided meditation | Extended silent sits | 4 weeks of consistent short sits |
| Solo meditation stability | Paired resonance practice | 4 weeks of stable solo practice |
| Body awareness (somatic) | Transpersonal body practices | 4 weeks of embodied practice |
| Grounding and centering | Any transpersonal practice | Established, reliable grounding skill |

│   "Simply observe your natural breathing rhythm."
├── VAS pain tracking (before/after each session)
├── Guided body relaxation (10 min, daily)
│   Focus on areas away from injury, building general calm
└── Sound healing: Gentle ambient tracks for rest and recovery

PHASE 2: Building (Weeks 3-4)
├── Coherent breathing (5-5 rhythm, 10 min, 2x daily)
│   "Breathe in for five counts, out for five counts."
├── Guided imagery for healing (10-15 min, daily)

## SEASONAL PRACTICE ADJUSTMENTS

### TCM Five Elements Framework

| Season | Element | Energy Quality | Practice Emphasis |
|--------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Spring** | Wood | Rising, expanding, creative | Vigorous breathwork, active movement, intention-setting, liver/gallbladder meridian work |
| **Summer** | Fire | Outward, joyful, connective | Paired practices, community, heart-opening, lighter meditation, outdoor practice |
| **Late Summer** | Earth | Centering, nourishing, grounding | Grounding meditation, nourishing practices, digestive support, routine stabilization |
| **Autumn** | Metal | Contracting, releasing, clarifying | Breath-focused practice (lung emphasis), letting-go meditation, grief processing, simplifying |
| **Winter** | Water | Inward, restoring, stillness | Deep meditation, restorative movement, kidney support, conservation of energy, solo practice |

### Ayurvedic Ritucharya (Seasonal Regimen)

| Season | Dosha Emphasis | Practice Adjustments |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Spring** (*Vasanta*) | Kapha pacifying | Stimulating breathwork, vigorous movement, lightening practices, early morning practice |
| **Summer** (*Grishma*) | Pitta pacifying | Cooling breathwork (shitali), gentle movement, moon-energy practices, water elements |
| **Autumn** (*Sharad*) | Pitta/Vata transition | Grounding, warmth, oil-based self-care, moderate pacing |
| **Early Winter** (*Hemanta*) | Vata pacifying | Warming breathwork, slow movement, nourishing practices, longer rest |
| **Late Winter** (*Shishira*) | Vata/Kapha | Building strength, preparatory practices for spring, gentle warming |
| **Monsoon** (*Varsha*) | Vata pacifying | Indoor practice, grounding, digestive fire support, stability focus |

### Seasonal Adjustment Principles

```
✅ Follow the energy of the season — expand in spring/summer, contract in autumn/winter
✅ Adjust practice intensity: more vigorous in warmer months, gentler in cooler months
✅ Cold exposure is naturally easier to begin in warmer months (gradual adaptation)
✅ Deep inner work (meditation, transpersonal) suits the inward energy of winter
✅ Paired and community practices align with the outward energy of summer
✅ Honor the body's seasonal needs for rest, activity, nourishment, and release
```

**Cultural framing:**
> "Seasonal adjustment is found across healing traditions — from TCM's Five
> Element theory to Ayurveda's *ritucharya* to the liturgical calendars of
> contemplative religious traditions. The insight is shared: our bodies and
> practices benefit from aligning with the rhythms of the natural world."

## PATHWAY CUSTOMIZATION GUIDELINES

### For Agents Recommending Pathways

```
1. LISTEN FIRST — Understand the user's goals, conditions, and preferences
2. SCREEN — Complete appropriate contraindication screening
3. SUGGEST — Offer a pathway as a starting point, not a mandate
4. ADAPT — Modify based on user feedback and outcome data
5. RESPECT — Honor the user's autonomy to deviate from the pathway
```

### User Controls

```
✅ User can skip any phase or practice
✅ User can repeat phases as needed
✅ User can combine elements from different pathways
✅ User can create their own pathway from available practices
✅ User sets their own pace — no pressure to "advance"
✅ User can pause and resume at any time
```

### Progression Is Not Linear

```
✅ "Returning to foundation practices is a sign of wisdom, not regression."
✅ "Some weeks call for less. That is part of the rhythm."
✅ "If a practice that once helped now feels wrong, trust that. Practices
    serve different seasons of life."
❌ NEVER frame returning to earlier phases as "going backward"
❌ NEVER use "levels" language that implies hierarchy
❌ NEVER pressure advancement to maintain engagement metrics
```

*"The path of healing is not a ladder to climb but a garden to tend. Some
seasons call for planting, others for pruning, and some for simply sitting
in the quiet and letting what has been planted grow."*
