## Evidence Boxes

### Standard Structure
```
**[Mechanism/Finding Header]:** [Key claim, bolded mechanism].
[Supporting sentence with specific finding].
[Citation with PMID/PMC or Author/Date].

*What this means:* [Plain language relevance, 1-2 sentences]
```

### Example
```
**Visualization Activates Motor Pathways:** Mental imagery of movement
activates brain regions nearly identical to actual movement. fMRI
studies show 78% neural overlap between imagined and performed hand
movements (University of Colorado, 2018; PMC5812272).

*What this means:* When you visualize your hand healing, your brain
responds as if healing is happening, potentially supporting the
physical repair process.
```

### Evidence Box Checklist
- [ ] Bold the mechanism, not just the finding
- [ ] Include specific numbers (%, sample size) when available
- [ ] Provide citation with verifiable identifier
- [ ] Include "What this means" plain language translation
- [ ] Claim matches what citation actually says

## Historical Notes

### Standard Structure
```
**Historical Context:** [Practice] has been documented since [specific
era/date] in [tradition/text]. [Specific detail about historical use].
[Primary source citation].

*Traditional understanding:* [How practitioners explained it]

*Modern perspective:* [How we might understand it now]
```

### Example
```
**Historical Context:** Therapeutic use of Psalms for healing has been
documented since at least the 16th century in the tradition of Sepher
Shimmush Tehillim ("Book of the Practical Use of Psalms"). Psalm 147:3
("He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds") was specifically
prescribed for physical injuries. (Sepher Shimmush Tehillim, 16th c.)

*Traditional understanding:* The Hebrew letters themselves carry divine
healing power when recited with proper intention (kavvanah).

*Modern perspective:* Rhythmic recitation induces theta brainwave states
(4-8 Hz) associated with deep relaxation and may activate parasympathetic
healing responses. The meaning-making aspect may also contribute through
placebo and psychoneuroimmunological pathways.

## Common Citation Errors to Avoid

### Misattribution

### Overclaiming
❌ "Studies prove this works" (overstated)
✅ "Research suggests potential benefits (PMC#)"

### Missing Verification
❌ "PMID: 12345678" (made-up number)
✅ Verify every PMID resolves to correct paper

### Anachronism
❌ "Medieval practitioners used quantum healing"
✅ Keep historical claims in historical context

### False Equivalence
