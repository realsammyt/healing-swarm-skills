## Core Voice Qualities

### 1. COMPASSIONATE
Not performative empathy. Genuine presence with suffering.

**Do:**
- Acknowledge what the user is experiencing
- Create space for the full range of emotions
- Offer support without pity

**Don't:**
- Use saccharine language ("Sending so much love!")
- Minimize experience ("It's not that bad")
- Offer false promises ("You'll feel better soon!")

**Examples:**
```
✗ "I'm so sorry you're going through this! Sending healing vibes!"
✓ "Healing takes time, and you're on a journey that matters."

✗ "Don't worry, this will make the pain go away!"
✓ "This practice may help support your body's natural healing process."
```

---

### 2. GROUNDED
Rooted in earth. Not ethereal. Not clinical. Present.

**Do:**
- Use concrete, sensory language
- Connect practices to body and breath
- Stay in the present moment

**Don't:**
- Float into vague abstractions
- Use excessive mystical language
- Lose connection to physical reality

**Examples:**
```
✗ "Allow the cosmic energy to flow through your celestial body..."
✓ "Feel your feet on the ground. Notice the weight of your body."

✗ "Transcend your earthly limitations..."
✓ "Breathe into the area that needs attention."
```

---

### 3. HONEST
Clear about what we know and don't know. Evidence-based humility.

**Do:**
- Distinguish between evidence levels
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Present both traditional wisdom and scientific findings

**Don't:**
- Overclaim effectiveness
- Dismiss traditional knowledge
- Present correlation as causation

**Examples:**
```
✗ "Science has proven this technique heals tissue 3x faster!"
✓ "Studies suggest this practice may support tissue recovery, though research is ongoing."

✗ "Ancient masters knew secrets modern science can't explain."
✓ "Traditional practitioners have used this method for centuries; modern research is beginning to explore why it may help."
```

---

### 4. EMPOWERING
The user is the healer. We support their journey.

**Do:**
- Position user as active participant
- Provide choices and options
- Celebrate autonomy

**Don't:**
- Create dependency on the app/practice
- Imply we're doing the healing
- Remove user agency

**Examples:**
```
✗ "This app will heal your injury."
✓ "This practice supports your body's capacity to heal."

✗ "You must do this every day for it to work."
✓ "You might explore practicing daily, or find a rhythm that works for you."
```

---

### 5. REVERENT
Deep respect for healing traditions. Not appropriative. Not dismissive.

**Do:**
- Name sources and lineages
- Acknowledge cultural context
- Express gratitude

**Don't:**
- Strip practices from their origins
- Treat traditions as consumable products
- Ignore sacred dimensions

**Examples:**
```
✗ "Ancient secrets of the Orient..."
✓ "This practice comes from Traditional Chinese Medicine, with roots in texts dating to 300 BCE."

✗ "Using mystical prayer technology..."
✓ "Drawing from the Jewish mystical tradition, where healing prayers have been practiced for millennia..."
```

## Writing Practices

### Sentence Length

- **Short** for instructions: "Breathe in. Hold. Exhale slowly."
- **Medium** for explanations: "This point is associated with healing in Traditional Chinese Medicine."
- **Varied** for immersive content: Mix rhythm for natural flow.

### Paragraph Length

- **One to three sentences** for most UI content
- **Longer passages** only for immersive reading experiences
- **Break complex information** into digestible pieces

### Active vs. Passive Voice

**Active for instructions:**
> "Press the point gently" (not "The point should be pressed")

**Passive acceptable for states:**
> "You are supported" / "Healing is invited"

### Person

- **Second person (you)** for direct guidance
- **First person plural (we)** when establishing community
- **Third person** when citing traditions/research

**Examples:**
```
"You might notice warmth in your palm." (Second person)
"We draw from the wisdom of many traditions." (First person plural)
"Researchers have found that..." (Third person)
```

## Specific Content Types

### Instructions

```
STRUCTURE:
1. What you'll do (brief overview)
2. How to position yourself
3. Step-by-step actions
4. What you might notice
5. How to complete/transition
```

**Example:**
> **What you'll do:** Apply gentle pressure to a healing point on your hand.
>

> 3. Breathe slowly as you maintain pressure for 1-2 minutes
>
> **Notice:** You may feel warmth, tingling, or simply relaxation.
>
> **Complete:** When ready, release the pressure and rest for a breath.

### Evidence Boxes

```
STRUCTURE:
1. Clear claim statement
2. Evidence summary (study type, sample, findings)
3. Limitations/caveats
4. Citation (PMID/DOI)
```

**Example:**
> **What research suggests:** Acupressure may reduce anxiety symptoms.
>
> **Evidence:** A meta-analysis of 39 randomized controlled trials (N=3,642)
> found moderate evidence that acupressure reduced self-reported anxiety
> compared to sham acupressure or standard care.
>
> **Note:** Most studies had methodological limitations. Effects varied by
> type and duration of acupressure.
>
> **Source:** Au DWH, et al. Effects of acupressure on anxiety: A systematic
> review and meta-analysis. J Anxiety Disord. 2015;36:88-101.

### Prayers/Invocations

```
STRUCTURE:
1. Opening (addressing/invoking)
2. Body (petition/intention)
3. Closing (gratitude/affirmation)
```

**Formatting:**
- Use line breaks for breathing space
- Italicize visualization cues
- Center-align or use indentation for reverent appearance

**Example:**
> *Close your eyes. Take a breath.*
>
> Raphael, angel of healing,
> whose name means "God heals,"
> I invite your presence
> as I tend to this body.
>
> *Imagine emerald green light surrounding you.*

>
> Amen.

### Visualizations

```
STRUCTURE:
1. Settle (grounding, breath)
2. Invoke (set scene, invite imagery)
3. Deepen (detailed sensory journey)
4. Transform (healing action)
5. Integrate (bring back, embody)
6. Return (gradual emergence)
```

**Pacing cues:**
- Use "..." for pauses

## Cultural Sensitivity

### Name the Source

Always attribute practices to their traditions of origin:

```
✗ "This meditation technique..."
✓ "This meditation technique from the Zen Buddhist tradition..."

✗ "Ancient healers knew..."
✓ "Practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine have long understood..."
```

### Avoid Exoticizing

```
✗ "The mysterious East has long known..."
✓ "East Asian medical traditions have documented..."

✗ "Tribal healing wisdom..."
✓ "Indigenous healing practices from [specific tradition]..."
```

### Acknowledge Adaptations

When adapting traditional practices:

> "This practice is adapted from [tradition]. The traditional form involves
> [X]; we've simplified it for accessibility while maintaining its core
> principles."

---

## Accessibility in Voice

### Cognitive Load

- One concept per sentence
- Clear transitions between ideas
- Summarize before diving deep

### Sensory Language

Include multiple sensory channels:

> "Notice what you see, hear, or feel in your body..."

Not just:

> "Visualize the light..." (excludes non-visual processors)

### Trauma-Informed Language

- Always offer choice: "If you'd like..." / "You might..."
- Never command body states: "Relax" → "Allow relaxation if it comes"
- Include exit ramps: "If this feels too intense, open your eyes and look around the room"
