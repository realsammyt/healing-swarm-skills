# Healing Swarm Contraindications Database

## Core Principle

**"Not every practice is safe for every person."**

Healing practices are powerful precisely because they affect physiology and
psychology. What benefits one person may harm another. Screening for
contraindications is not bureaucratic caution — it is an expression of care.

---

## SEVERITY LEVELS

| Level | Label | Meaning | Action |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Absolute** | NEVER do | Practice poses serious risk; no safe modification exists | Do NOT recommend. Redirect to safe alternatives |
| **Relative** | WITH MODIFICATIONS | Practice may be safe with specific adaptations | Recommend modified version only. State modifications clearly |
| **Caution** | PROCEED CAREFULLY | Practice is likely safe but warrants awareness | Note the consideration. Encourage self-monitoring. Recommend slower progression |
