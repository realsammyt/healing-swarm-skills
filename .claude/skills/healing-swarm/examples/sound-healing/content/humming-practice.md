# Vagal Toning: A Humming Practice

**Tradition:** Adapted from *Bhramari pranayama* (Vedic tradition, c. 1500 BCE) and modern vagal toning research
**Duration:** 10 minutes
**Level:** Beginner (Humming)
**Practice Type:** Humming / Vocal Toning
**Best for:** Stress relief, calming the nervous system, beginners to sound practice

---

## Overview

This is a simple, 10-minute humming practice designed for complete
beginners. No musical training, no special equipment, no specific
tradition required — just your voice and your breath. Humming is one
of the most accessible forms of sound healing: you hum on your exhale,
feel the vibration in your body, and let your nervous system settle.

> **Evidence note:** Research suggests that humming may stimulate the
> vagus nerve through laryngeal vibration, potentially promoting
> parasympathetic activation. A pilot fMRI study (Kalyani et al. 2011,
> n=12) found that Om chanting produced limbic deactivation patterns
> similar to vagal nerve stimulation. Humming has also been shown to
> increase nasal nitric oxide production (Weitzberg & Lundberg 2002,
> n=10). While these findings are promising, most studies have small
> sample sizes and the long-term effects of sustained humming practice
> require further research.

## Tradition Attribution

This practice is adapted from *Bhramari pranayama* (bee breath),
documented in the *Hatha Yoga Pradipika* (Svatmarama, 15th century CE)
and rooted in earlier Vedic breath and sound traditions (c. 1500 BCE).
The modern framing through vagal nerve stimulation draws from Stephen
Porges' Polyvagal Theory (1994) and subsequent research.

We honor the Vedic yogic lineages that formalized therapeutic humming
as a contemplative practice. Our adaptation simplifies the traditional
form — omitting *Shanmukhi mudra* (ear-closing hand position) and
specific breath ratios — for accessibility while maintaining the core
principle: humming on the exhale as a pathway to calm.

**Open practice status:** Humming and *Bhramari pranayama* are open
practices, widely taught without initiation requirement.

## Safety — Read Before Every Session

### Volume and Hearing
- Practice at a **comfortable volume** — this should never hurt
- If you have **tinnitus**, keep your humming very soft and stop if
  ringing increases
- If you wear **hearing aids**, you may leave them in for this gentle
  practice, but remove them if sound feels uncomfortable

### Environment
- Sit in a **comfortable position** where you can make sound without
  self-consciousness
- A quiet space is helpful but not required
- Have water nearby for throat comfort

### Do Not Practice Vigorous Toning If You Have:
- Active ear infection or recent ear surgery
- Vocal cord conditions (nodules, polyps, laryngitis)
- Severe sound sensitivity or hyperacusis
- Active respiratory infection with sore throat
- Any condition your healthcare provider has advised against vocal exercise

### Stop Immediately If You Experience:
- Ear pain or sudden hearing changes
- Persistent dizziness
- Voice pain or loss
- Chest pain or difficulty breathing
- New ringing in ears that was not present before

*If you have any medical conditions, consult your healthcare provider
before beginning this practice.*

## Before You Begin

### You'll Need
- 10 minutes of uninterrupted time
- A comfortable seated position (chair, cushion, or floor)
- A space where you can hum without interruption
- Optional: a glass of water nearby

### Preparation
1. Sit comfortably — spine upright but not rigid
2. Relax your jaw — let your lips part slightly, then gently close them
3. Roll your shoulders back and release tension in your neck
4. Take 3 natural breaths to settle
5. Place one hand on your chest (you'll feel the vibration here)

---

## The Practice

### Warm-Up: Jaw and Throat Release (2 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Gently prepare your throat and jaw for humming.

**How to do it:**
1. Open your mouth wide and yawn (or fake a yawn) — this relaxes
   the throat
2. Gently massage your jaw joints with your fingertips (small circles)
3. Let your jaw hang loose — lips together, teeth apart
4. Sigh audibly on your next exhale: "Ahhhhh..." at whatever pitch
   comes naturally
5. Repeat 2-3 sighs, each time letting your jaw soften more

**What you might notice:**
- Your jaw may click or pop (normal, gentle release)
- Your throat opening and relaxing
- Your breathing naturally deepening

*There is no correct sound. Whatever comes out is right.*

---

### Core Practice Part 1: Simple Humming (3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Hum on each exhale at whatever pitch feels comfortable.

**How to do it:**
1. Close your lips gently
2. Inhale naturally through your nose
3. As you exhale, begin humming — "Mmmmmmm..."
4. Let the hum last the full length of your exhale
5. When the breath runs out, inhale naturally and hum again
6. Continue this rhythm: inhale... hum... inhale... hum...

**Sound guidance:**
- **Pitch:** Whatever feels comfortable. Not too high, not too low.
  If you're unsure, start with a gentle sigh and close your lips —
  that's your pitch
- **Volume:** Moderate. Like humming a lullaby to yourself. You should
  be able to sustain this without any throat strain
- **Rhythm:** Follow your natural breath. No need to count or time.
  The hum simply fills your exhale

**What you might notice:**
- Vibration in your chest, throat, or face
- Tingling in your lips or sinuses
- A natural calming of your breathing rhythm
- Warmth in your chest
- Nothing at all (also completely fine)

*If your voice cracks, wavers, or sounds "wrong" to you — that's
completely normal. This is not a performance. The vibration is what
matters, not the sound quality.*

---

### Silence Interval (30 seconds)

**Pause your humming.**

Sit in silence for a moment. Keep your hand on your chest.

Notice:
- How does the silence feel after the sound?
- Can you still sense vibration in your body?
- How is your breathing now compared to when you started?

*The silence after sound is part of the practice.*

---

### Core Practice Part 2: Humming with Body Awareness (3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Continue humming, now with attention to where the vibration resonates
in your body.

**How to do it:**
1. Resume humming on each exhale
2. Keep one hand on your chest
3. After a few hums, try placing your hand on your throat instead
4. After a few more, try your hand on the side of your face or
   forehead
5. Notice: where do you feel the vibration most clearly?
6. Return your hand to wherever the vibration feels strongest —
   that's your resonance point for today

**Exploration (optional):**
- Try humming slightly higher and notice how the vibration moves
  upward (toward face and head)
- Try humming slightly lower and notice how the vibration moves
  downward (toward chest)
- There is no better or worse — just noticing

**What you might notice:**
- Vibration shifting location as you change pitch
- One area of your body resonating more strongly than others
- Deepening calm or focus
- Emotional softening (tears, sighing — all normal)

*Continue humming for about 3 minutes. No need to watch the clock —
when it feels like enough, move to the cool-down.*

---

### Cool-Down: Softening to Silence (1.5 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Gradually transition from humming to silence.

**How to do it:**
1. Over the next few exhales, gradually make your humming softer
2. Softer still — barely audible
3. One last hum — let it be the quietest yet
4. Let the final hum fade into silence naturally
5. Sit in the silence for 30-60 seconds
6. Keep your eyes closed (or softly focused downward)

**What you might notice:**
- The silence feeling different than before the practice
- Heightened awareness of ambient sounds
- Deep calm or a sense of spaciousness
- Your body feeling warm or heavy with relaxation

*Don't rush past the silence. This is where the practice settles
into your body.*

---

### Closing (30 seconds)

**What you'll do:**
Ground yourself and transition gently.

**How to do it:**
1. Return to natural breathing — no more humming
2. Feel the weight of your body on the chair or cushion
3. Notice your feet on the floor (or your legs on the surface)
4. Gently wiggle your fingers and toes
5. When ready, open your eyes softly
6. Take a sip of water if available

**What you might notice:**
- Deep relaxation or gentle alertness
- Your voice feeling warmer or clearer
- Emotional tenderness or quiet calm
- Or: nothing notable — all responses are valid

*Take a gentle moment before moving on with your day. Your nervous
system just had a calming experience — honor that with a soft
transition.*

## Variations

### If this feels too intense
- Hum more softly — barely audible is fine
- Shorten the practice to 5 minutes
- Skip the body awareness exploration
- Take longer silence intervals
- Stop at any point — partial practice counts

### If you want to deepen the practice
- Extend to 15-20 minutes
- Add Om (Aum) toning: "Ahhh... Ohhh... Mmmmm..." on each exhale
- Try *Bhramari* with ears covered (thumbs gently on ear flaps)
- Practice with eyes closed for deeper inward focus
- Explore different pitches intentionally

### For limited vocal capacity
- Whispered humming (subvocal, barely vibrating)
- Very soft, barely audible humming
- Focus on the feeling of vibration, not the volume
- Or: listening-only variation (play a recording of singing bowls
  or sustained tones and simply listen with body awareness)

### For different times of day
- **Morning:** Slightly brighter pitch, moderate volume — energizing
- **Midday:** 3-5 minutes of soft humming — reset
- **Evening:** Lower pitch, softer volume, longer silence — calming

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Suggestion |
|-------|------------|
| "I can't find a comfortable pitch" | Start by sighing with sound ("Ahhhh") and notice where your voice naturally lands. Close your lips on that pitch. That's your starting point |
| Throat feels scratchy | Drink water. Reduce your volume. Humming should never strain. If it persists, rest your voice and try again another day |
| Feeling self-conscious | Try when alone. Close your eyes. Remind yourself: no one is listening, there is no audience, there is no wrong sound |
| Lightheaded | Normal if mild — you're extending your exhale. Pause, breathe normally for 30 seconds, then continue at lower intensity |
| No sensations at all | This is fine. Effects build over sessions. Focus on the rhythm of inhale-hum-inhale-hum. That's the whole practice |
| Emotional release | Normal and healthy. Humming can release stored tension. Let the emotion move through, then return to humming when ready |
| Can't sustain the hum very long | Your exhale length will naturally increase with practice. Short hums are perfectly valid — even 3-4 seconds of humming is practice |

---

## Journal Prompt

After your practice, you might reflect on:

- Where in your body did you feel the most vibration today?
- How did the quality of silence change after the humming?
- What was your breathing like at the end compared to the beginning?
- Did any emotions or images arise during the practice?

*Journaling is optional. There is no requirement to report a particular
experience.*

---

## Building a Practice

**Frequency:** 3-5 times per week. Daily is ideal if it feels sustainable.
Consistency matters more than duration.

**Timeline:** Allow 1-2 weeks to feel comfortable with humming. Most
people notice shifts in body awareness and relaxation within 2-3 weeks
of regular practice.

**Progression:**
- Week 1-2: This practice (10 minutes, simple humming)
- Week 3-4: Add Om toning or explore pitch variation
- Month 2+: Explore mantra practice or extend to 15-20 minutes
- Ongoing: Deepen body awareness, explore traditions

## Background

### About Bhramari Pranayama

*Bhramari pranayama* (bee breath) is a breathing and sound practice
from the Vedic yogic tradition, documented in the *Hatha Yoga
Pradipika* (Svatmarama, 15th century CE). The name comes from
*bhramari*, the Sanskrit word for a type of black Indian bee. The
practice involves producing a humming sound on the exhale, mimicking
the buzzing of a bee.

In its traditional form, *Bhramari* is often combined with *Shanmukhi
mudra* (closing the ears, eyes, and nostrils with the fingers) to
amplify internal resonance. The practice is described as calming the
mind and preparing the practitioner for deeper states of meditation.

### Key Research

- **Kalyani et al. (2011)** — "Neurohemodynamic correlates of 'OM'
  chanting" (Int J Yoga). fMRI study, n=12. Om chanting produced
  limbic deactivation similar to vagal nerve stimulation.
- **Weitzberg & Lundberg (2002)** — "Humming greatly increases nasal
  nitric oxide" (Am J Respir Crit Care Med). n=10. Humming increased
  nasal NO production approximately 15-fold.
- **Vickhoff et al. (2013)** — "Music structure determines heart rate
  variability of singers" (Front Psychol). n=15. Group singing
  synchronized HRV patterns.

*Note: While promising, the evidence base for humming-based practices
is still developing. Most studies have small sample sizes. The
traditional use of humming in contemplative practice predates clinical
research by millennia.*

*This practice is adapted from Bhramari pranayama, a breath and sound
practice from the Vedic yogic tradition (c. 1500 BCE), documented in

framework draws from Stephen Porges' Polyvagal Theory (1994). We honor
both the ancient tradition and the contemporary research that inform
this work.*

*This practice complements but does not replace medical care. Consult
your healthcare provider before beginning any new health practice.*
