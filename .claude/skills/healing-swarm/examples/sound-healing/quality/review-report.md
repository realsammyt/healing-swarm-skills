## Clinical Accuracy Review

**Reviewer:** clinical-reviewer

### Evidence Assessment

| Claim Made | Evidence Cited | Accurate? | Appropriately Qualified? |
|------------|---------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Humming may stimulate vagal tone | Kalyani 2011 | Yes | Yes — "may stimulate" |
| Om chanting produces limbic deactivation | Kalyani 2011 (n=12) | Yes | Yes — sample size noted |
| Humming increases nasal NO | Weitzberg 2002 (n=10) | Yes | Yes — sample size noted |
| Humming extends exhalation naturally | General physiology | Yes | Yes — no overclaim |

### Safety Assessment

| Safety Element | Present? | Adequate? |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Volume/hearing safety | Yes | Yes |
| Tinnitus modification | Yes | Yes |
| Vocal cord contraindications | Yes | Yes |
| Dizziness warning (CO2 from extended exhale) | Yes | Yes |
| Red flag symptoms | Yes | Yes |
| Medical disclaimer | Yes | Yes |

### Mechanism Description

- [x] Vagal stimulation mechanism described accurately

## Recommendations for Future Iteration

1. **Audio companion:** Consider recording a reference humming tone
   that practitioners can optionally play alongside their practice
2. **Group variation:** Add guidance for practicing with a partner
   or small group (with consent framework per ethics-guardrails.md)
3. **Integration guidance:** Add explicit connection to breathwork
   protocols (Bhramari as bridge between breathwork and sound healing)
4. **Longitudinal tracking:** Consider journal prompts that track
   changes over weeks of practice (e.g., resting heart rate, perceived
   stress) while noting these are self-reported observations, not
   clinical measures
