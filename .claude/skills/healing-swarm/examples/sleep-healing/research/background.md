## Asclepian Dream Temples (Greek, c. 500 BCE)

The most formalized ancient sleep healing tradition centered on the
*Asclepieia* — healing sanctuaries dedicated to Asclepius, god of
medicine. Over 300 sanctuaries existed across the ancient Greek and
Roman world, with major sites at Epidaurus, Pergamon, and Kos.

### The Practice of *Incubation* (ἐγκοίμησις)

Patients seeking healing would undergo preparatory rituals — fasting,
bathing, offerings — before sleeping in the *abaton* (sacred dormitory).
During sleep, Asclepius was believed to visit in dreams, providing
diagnosis or direct healing. Upon waking, temple priests (*therapeutae*)
helped interpret the dream and prescribe treatment.

### Key Features
- Sleep as a healing modality (not merely rest)
- Structured preparation before sleep (ritual, environment, intention)
- Dream incubation (sleeping with a specific healing question)
- Morning interpretation and integration
- Environment optimization (sacred, quiet, intentionally designed spaces)

### Modern Parallels
The Asclepian model anticipated several modern sleep medicine concepts:
environment preparation, pre-sleep routine, intention setting, and
morning reflection. Dream incubation is now studied in contemporary
psychology (Saredi et al., 1997; White & Taytroe, 2003).

## TCM Organ Clock and Sleep Theory

Traditional Chinese Medicine understands sleep through the framework of
*qi* (vital energy) circulation and the organ clock — a 24-hour cycle
in which *qi* is understood to flow through specific organ systems at
designated times.

### The Organ Clock and Sleep

| Time | Organ System | Relevance to Sleep |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 9-11 PM | San Jiao (Triple Burner) | Preparation for sleep, endocrine regulation |
| 11 PM-1 AM | Gallbladder | Deep sleep onset, decision processing |
| 1-3 AM | Liver | Deep sleep, blood storage, emotional processing |
| 3-5 AM | Lung | Transition toward waking, grief processing |
| 5-7 AM | Large Intestine | Waking, elimination, release |

### Liver-Blood Relationship

In TCM theory, the liver stores blood during sleep. Insufficient
liver-blood is associated with restless sleep, vivid disturbing dreams,
and early waking (particularly between 1-3 AM). Treatments focus on
nourishing liver-blood through diet, herbal medicine, and acupuncture.

### Sleep Disturbance Patterns (TCM)
- Difficulty falling asleep: often attributed to heart-fire or liver-qi
  stagnation
- Waking between 1-3 AM: liver-blood deficiency or liver-qi stagnation
- Dream-disturbed sleep: heart-blood deficiency, phlegm-fire
- Early morning waking: lung-qi deficiency

**Note:** TCM organ system terms (liver, heart, lung) refer to
functional systems in TCM theory, not solely to the anatomical organs.

## Tibetan Dream Yoga (11th Century CE)

Dream yoga (*milam*) is one of the Six Yogas of Naropa, a set of
advanced Tantric Buddhist meditation practices attributed to the Indian
*mahasiddha* Naropa (1016-1100 CE) and transmitted to Tibet by Marpa
Lotsawa (1012-1097 CE).

### The Six Yogas of Naropa
1. *Tummo* (inner heat)
2. *Gyulu* (illusory body)
3. **Milam (dream yoga)**
4. *Osel* (clear light)
5. *Bardo* (intermediate state)
6. *Phowa* (transference of consciousness)

### Dream Yoga Practice Structure
1. **Day practice:** Recognizing waking experience as dream-like (not
   dissociation — a contemplative reframing within a stable meditation
   foundation)
2. **Pre-sleep practice:** Visualization, intention setting, sleeping
   in specific postures (lion's pose — right side, right hand under cheek)
3. **Dream recognition:** Developing the capacity to recognize the dream
   state while dreaming (lucid dreaming within a contemplative framework)
4. **Dream transformation:** Working with dream content for spiritual
   insight
5. **Clear light practice:** Maintaining awareness through dreamless sleep

### Important Context
Dream yoga is an advanced practice within Vajrayana Buddhism. It
traditionally requires:
- Foundation in shamatha (calm-abiding) and vipassana (insight) meditation
- Empowerment from a qualified teacher
- Extensive preliminary practices
- Understanding of Buddhist philosophy (particularly emptiness and
  dependent origination)

Our adaptations simplify preparatory elements for accessibility while
acknowledging the tradition's depth. We do not teach dream yoga as a
complete Buddhist practice.

## Ayurvedic Sleep Protocols

Ayurveda (*ayus* = life, *veda* = knowledge) includes detailed sleep
protocols as part of *dinacharya* (daily routine) and *ratricharya*
(nighttime routine).

### Evening Practices from Classical Texts
- **Warm milk** (with nutmeg, cardamom, or turmeric) — pacifies *vata*
  dosha, promotes calm
- **Foot oiling** (*padabhyanga*) — warm sesame oil on soles of feet,
  traditionally associated with calming the nervous system
- **Head oiling** — warm oil on crown of head (Brahmarandhra)
- **Evening prayer/meditation** — settling the mind before sleep
- **Left nostril breathing** (*Chandra Nadi*) — associated with cooling,
  calming lunar energy

### Dosha and Sleep
- **Vata** constitution: tendency toward light, interrupted sleep.
  Remedies: warm, heavy, grounding practices
- **Pitta** constitution: difficulty falling asleep (overactive mind).
  Remedies: cooling practices, avoiding stimulation
- **Kapha** constitution: tendency toward excessive sleep.
  Remedies: lighter evening meals, stimulating morning routine

### Optimal Sleep Timing
Ayurveda recommends sleeping during *kapha* time (6-10 PM onset),
which is associated with heaviness and natural drowsiness. Staying
awake past 10 PM enters *pitta* time, associated with a "second wind"
of mental activity.

## Jewish Dream Interpretation (Talmud Berakhot 55a-57b)

The Babylonian Talmud devotes significant discussion to dreams in
Tractate Berakhot (Blessings), pages 55a through 57b.

### Key Teachings
- "A dream uninterpreted is like a letter unopened" (Berakhot 55a) —
  dreams have meaning worth attending to
- Dreams may contain elements of prophecy, but also elements of nonsense
  — discernment is required
- The interpretation affects the dream's significance: "All dreams
  follow the mouth" (Berakhot 55b) — suggesting that interpretation
  is creative, not merely receptive
- "Neither a good dream nor a bad dream is fulfilled entirely"
  (Berakhot 55a)

### Sleep Blessings
The Jewish liturgical tradition includes the *Shema al HaMitah*
(Bedtime Shema), a prayer sequence recited before sleep that includes:
- Forgiveness of those who have wronged you
- Entrusting the soul to divine care ("Into Your hand I entrust my
  spirit" — Psalm 31:6)
- Protection during sleep
- Gratitude upon waking (*Modeh Ani*)

### Relevance to Practice
The Talmudic approach offers a nuanced framework: dreams matter, but
interpretation is subjective and co-creative. This aligns with our
approach to dream journaling — attend to dreams without authoritative
interpretation.

## Summary: Cross-Cultural Themes

Despite their different frameworks, these traditions share several themes:

1. **Sleep as active, not passive** — Sleep is a practice, not merely
   the absence of waking
2. **Environment matters** — Sacred spaces, prepared rooms, intentional
   conditions
3. **Pre-sleep ritual** — Structured transition from waking to sleeping
4. **Dream significance** — Dreams carry information worth attending to
5. **Morning integration** — What happens after waking is part of the
   practice
6. **Humility about interpretation** — Dreams are meaningful but not
   reducible to simple formulas

These shared themes inform our practice design while respecting each
tradition's unique context and requirements.
