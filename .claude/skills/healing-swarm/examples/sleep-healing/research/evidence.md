## Sleep Hygiene Interventions

### Evidence Level: Strong (for components)

Sleep hygiene refers to behavioral and environmental practices that
promote healthy sleep. While sleep hygiene education alone is not
sufficient for treating clinical insomnia (CBT-I is the gold standard),
individual components have strong evidence.

### Key Studies

**Irish, L.A. et al. (2015).** "The role of sleep hygiene in promoting
public health: A review of empirical evidence." *Sleep Medicine Reviews*,
22, 23-36.
- Comprehensive review of sleep hygiene research
- Found consistent associations between sleep hygiene behaviors and
  sleep quality
- Noted that multicomponent interventions are more effective than
  single-behavior changes
- Limitation: many studies correlational, not experimental

**Murawski, B. et al. (2018).** "A systematic review and meta-analysis
of cognitive and behavioral interventions to improve sleep health in
adults without sleep disorders." *Sleep Medicine Reviews*, 40, 160-169.
- Meta-analysis of sleep interventions in non-clinical populations
- Found that multicomponent sleep hygiene interventions significantly
  improved sleep quality
- Effect sizes moderate (Cohen's d 0.30-0.50)
- Note: greatest effects from stimulus control and sleep restriction
  components (adapted from CBT-I)

**Stepanski, E.J. & Wyatt, J.K. (2003).** "Use of sleep hygiene in
the treatment of insomnia." *Sleep Medicine Reviews*, 7(3), 215-225.
- Found that sleep hygiene alone is insufficient for chronic insomnia
- Recommended as adjunct to CBT-I, not replacement
- Individual hygiene components (caffeine, exercise timing, environment)
  have independent evidence

### Specific Component Evidence

| Component | Evidence | Key Finding |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Room temperature (60-67°F) | Moderate-strong | Cooler temperatures support sleep onset and deep sleep (Okamoto-Mizuno & Mizuno, 2012) |
| Darkness/light reduction | Strong | Light exposure suppresses melatonin; darkness supports circadian rhythm (Gooley et al., 2011) |
| Caffeine timing | Strong | Caffeine 6 hours before bed significantly disrupts sleep (Drake et al., 2013) |
| Consistent wake time | Strong | Regular wake time strengthens circadian rhythm (Monk et al., 2003) |
| Screen/blue light | Moderate | Evening blue light suppresses melatonin by ~50% (Chang et al., 2015, PNAS) |
| Stimulus control | Strong (CBT-I component) | Bed for sleep only; leave bed if awake > 20 min (Bootzin & Epstein, 2011) |

## Bedtime Meditation and Body Scan

### Evidence Level: Moderate

**Black, D.S. et al. (2015).** "Mindfulness Meditation and Improvement
in Sleep Quality and Daytime Impairment Among Older Adults With Sleep
Disturbances." *JAMA Internal Medicine*, 175(4), 494-501.
- Randomized controlled trial, n=49 (older adults with sleep disturbance)
- Mindfulness Awareness Practice (MAP) vs. Sleep Hygiene Education (SHE)
- MAP group showed significantly greater improvement in sleep quality
  (PSQI: -2.8 vs. -1.1, p=0.04)
- Also improved insomnia symptoms, depression, and fatigue
- Limitation: small sample, older adult population only

**Ong, J.C. et al. (2014).** "A Randomized Controlled Trial of
Mindfulness Meditation for Chronic Insomnia." *Sleep*, 37(9), 1553-1563.
- RCT, n=54 (adults with chronic insomnia)
- Mindfulness-Based Therapy for Insomnia (MBTI) vs. MBSR vs. self-monitoring
- MBTI showed significant reduction in insomnia severity
- Pre-sleep arousal (cognitive and somatic) reduced
- Effects maintained at 6-month follow-up
- Limitation: moderate sample size

**Hubbling, A. et al. (2014).** "How mindfulness changed my sleep:
focus groups with chronic insomnia patients." *BMC Complementary and
Alternative Medicine*, 14, 50.
- Qualitative study — patient experiences with mindfulness for insomnia
- Key themes: acceptance of sleeplessness (reducing performance anxiety),
  body awareness, reduced cognitive arousal
- Supports the mechanism: meditation works for sleep partly by reducing
  the *effort* to sleep

### Body Scan Specifically

**Dreeben, S.J. et al. (2013).** "Body scan meditation and mindfulness
practices." In *Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy*. Guilford Press.
- Body scan as a component of mindfulness-based interventions
- Promotes interoceptive awareness and somatic relaxation
- Particularly suitable for bedtime (lying down, progressive, calming)

### Yoga Nidra for Sleep

**Moszeik, E.N. et al. (2020).** "Effectiveness of a short Yoga Nidra
meditation on stress, sleep, and well-being in a large and diverse
sample." *Current Psychology*, 41, 5272-5286.
- Large sample (n=341), pre-post design
- 11-minute yoga nidra practice
- Significant improvements in stress, sleep quality, and well-being
- Limitation: no control group, self-selected sample

**Datta, K. et al. (2021).** "Yoga Nidra practice shows improvement
in sleep in patients with chronic insomnia: A randomized controlled
trial." *National Medical Journal of India*, 34(3), 143-150.
- RCT, n=41 (chronic insomnia patients)
- Yoga nidra group showed significant improvement in sleep onset
  latency, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency
- Limitation: small sample, single site

## Dream Journaling and Emotional Processing

### Evidence Level: Preliminary

**Edwards, C.L. et al. (2013).** "Dreaming and insight." *Frontiers in
Psychology*, 4, 979.
- Review of evidence linking dreaming to emotional processing and
  insight
- REM sleep associated with emotional memory consolidation
- Dream content reflects waking emotional concerns
- Engaging with dream content may support emotional processing
- Note: mechanisms still debated

**Cartwright, R.D. (2010).** *The Twenty-Four Hour Mind: The Role of
Sleep and Dreaming in Our Emotional Lives*. Oxford University Press.
- Comprehensive overview of dreaming and emotional regulation
- Dreams as a form of overnight emotional processing
- Dream journaling as a tool for accessing this processing
- Clinical applications for depression and PTSD recovery

**Schredl, M. & Erlacher, D. (2007).** "Self-reported effects of
dreams on waking-life creativity: An empirical study." *Journal of
Psychology*, 141(1), 35-46.
- Survey study (n=444)
- Significant minority report that attending to dreams influences
  waking problem-solving and creativity
- Supports dream journaling as a reflective practice
- Limitation: self-report, correlational

### Dream Incubation

**White, G.L. & Taytroe, L. (2003).** "Personal problem-solving
using dream incubation: Dreaming, relaxation, or waking cognition?"
*Dreaming*, 13(4), 193-209.
- Experimental study comparing dream incubation with relaxation and
  waking cognition for problem-solving
- Dream incubation group reported subjectively more useful insights
- Limitation: small sample, subjective outcome measures

## CBT-I as Gold Standard (Context)

### Evidence Level: Strong

For completeness and honest framing, it is important to note that
CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) is the established
first-line treatment for chronic insomnia.

**Trauer, J.M. et al. (2015).** "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for
Chronic Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis." *Annals of
Internal Medicine*, 163(3), 191-204.
- Meta-analysis of 20 RCTs
- CBT-I significantly improved sleep onset latency, wake after sleep
  onset, sleep efficiency, and sleep quality
- Effects maintained at follow-up
- Recommended as first-line treatment over pharmacotherapy

**Our practices are complementary to, not a replacement for, CBT-I.**
For users with chronic insomnia, we always recommend CBT-I referral.
