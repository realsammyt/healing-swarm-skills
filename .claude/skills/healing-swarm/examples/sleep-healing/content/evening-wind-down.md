# Evening Wind-Down: Sleep Healing Practice

**Type:** Wind-Down / Bedtime Meditation
**Optimal Time:** Evening — begin 30 minutes before bed
**Duration:** 20 minutes
**Level:** Beginner
**Best for:** Supporting natural sleep onset, calming an active mind, establishing an evening routine

---

## Overview

This gentle evening practice combines sleep hygiene principles with a
progressive body scan to support your body's natural transition into
sleep. Beginning with a brief calming routine and moving into a guided
body scan relaxation, the practice progressively dims in pace and
intensity — mirroring the descent into sleep.

> **Evidence note:** Sleep hygiene interventions have a strong evidence
> base for supporting sleep quality in non-clinical populations
> (Murawski et al., 2018). Body scan meditation has been associated
> with improved sleep quality (Black et al., 2015, JAMA Internal
> Medicine, n=49). For persistent insomnia, CBT-I remains the
> recommended first-line treatment.

## Medical Disclaimer

**If you experience persistent insomnia (difficulty sleeping 3 or more
nights per week for 3 or more months), consult a sleep medicine
specialist.** CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) is the
recommended first-line treatment for chronic insomnia and is more
effective than sleep medication for long-term outcomes.

*This practice supports your body's natural sleep process. It does not
replace medical evaluation or treatment for sleep disorders.*

## Safety — Read Before Every Session

### Contraindications — Consult a Specialist If You Have:
- Narcolepsy (some relaxation practices may trigger cataplexy)
- Parasomnia (sleepwalking, sleep eating, REM behavior disorder)
- Untreated obstructive sleep apnea
- Active psychosis or psychotic features
- Severe PTSD with trauma-related nightmares (seek IRT with a trained
  therapist)

### Screen Safety
- **Dark mode mandatory** for any screen-delivered version of this practice
- Minimum screen brightness with warm color temperature
- **Auto-shutoff** after practice completion
- Audio-only mode recommended — consider listening with eyes closed
- Print-friendly version available for screen-free practice

### Stop or Modify If You Experience:
- Increased anxiety or racing thoughts during the practice
- Distressing imagery during visualization
- Feeling of being "trapped" in relaxation (open eyes, sit up, ground)
- Worsening sleep after 2+ weeks of consistent practice

*If this feels overwhelming at any point, open your eyes, feel your
feet on the floor, and take a few normal breaths. Rest is enough.*

## Tradition Attribution

> This practice integrates elements from several traditions. The evening
> routine structure draws from Ayurvedic *dinacharya* (daily routine),
> documented in the Charaka Samhita (c. 200 BCE), which prescribes
> specific evening practices for promoting restful sleep. The body scan
> relaxation draws from progressive muscle relaxation (Jacobson, 1930s)
> and mindfulness-based body awareness practices. The overall approach
> is informed by behavioral sleep medicine principles (stimulus control,
> sleep hygiene education) developed since the 1970s.
>
> We honor the traditions that have preserved sleep wisdom and acknowledge
> the modern clinicians who have built the evidence base for these
> practices.

## Environment Preparation

### Room Setup
- **Temperature:** 60-67°F / 15-19°C (a cool room supports sleep onset)
- **Lighting:** Dim warm light only — a bedside lamp with a warm bulb,
  or a battery-operated candle. No overhead lights.
- **Sound:** Quiet environment. Optional: a fan or white noise machine
  for consistent ambient sound.
- **Devices:** Phone on Do Not Disturb mode. If using for this practice:
  dark mode on, minimum brightness, auto-shutoff set. Otherwise, phone
  face-down or in another room.

### You'll Need
- 20 minutes of uninterrupted time
- Your bed, ready for sleep (you will not need to get up again)
- Comfortable sleep clothing (already changed)
- Optional: warm herbal tea (chamomile or passionflower)
- Optional: journal and pen beside bed (for morning)

---

## Pre-Sleep Routine (10 minutes before the practice)

### 30 Minutes Before Bed
- Put away work materials, close laptop
- Dim household lights (switch to warm lamps or low settings)
- Optional: prepare warm herbal tea
- Optional: brief gentle stretching (neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, forward
  fold — nothing vigorous)
- Quiet activity: read a physical book, listen to calm music, or simply
  sit with your tea

*This is the transition from "doing" to "being." There is nothing left
to accomplish tonight.*

## The Practice

### Phase 1: Arrival (3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Settle into bed and let the day go.

**How to do it:**
1. Lie in your preferred sleep position — whatever feels natural tonight
2. Pull the covers up to where they feel comfortable
3. Take one deep breath in through your nose... and let it go through
   your mouth with a gentle sigh. Let the sigh carry whatever it carries.
4. Take a second breath... and sigh it out. You might notice your
   shoulders drop slightly.
5. Take a third breath... and this time, let the exhale be quiet.
   Simply release.
6. Allow your eyes to close when they want to. No rush.
7. Silently acknowledge: "The day is complete. I can set it down now."

**What you might notice:**
- Your mind may still be reviewing the day — this is normal. You don't
  need to stop it. Just notice, and return to the feeling of the bed
  beneath you.
- Your body may still be holding tension — the next phase will
  gently address this.
- You may already feel drowsy — welcome it. If sleep comes now, let it.

*There is no urgency. No performance. Rest is the practice.*

### Phase 2: Body Scan Relaxation (12 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Slowly move your attention through your body, inviting each area to
soften and release.

**How to do it:**

*Begin at the crown of your head.*

1. **Forehead and scalp.** Bring gentle attention to your forehead.
   Notice any holding. You don't need to change it — just notice.
   Invite softening: "My forehead softens..."
   Take 2-3 slow breaths here.

2. **Eyes and temples.** Allow your eyes to feel heavy behind closed
   lids. Let the muscles around your eyes release. Your temples
   soften...
   2-3 breaths.

3. **Jaw and mouth.** This is where many people hold tension.
   Let your jaw hang slightly open. Your tongue rests on the floor
   of your mouth. Your lips part just barely...
   2-3 breaths.

4. **Neck and throat.** The back of your neck softens against the
   pillow. Your throat is open and relaxed...
   2-3 breaths.

5. **Shoulders.** Allow them to melt into the bed. They have nothing
   to carry right now. Let gravity do the work...
   2-3 breaths.

6. **Arms and hands.** Feel the weight of your arms. Your hands are
   open and soft — fingers gently curled, holding nothing...
   2-3 breaths.

7. **Chest and heart.** Notice the gentle rise and fall of your breath.
   You don't need to change it. Just feel the rhythm...
   2-3 breaths.

8. **Belly.** Let your belly be soft. No holding in. Let it rise and
   fall naturally with each breath...
   2-3 breaths.

9. **Lower back and hips.** Feel where your lower back meets the bed.
   Let your hips feel heavy. The bed is supporting your full weight...
   2-3 breaths.

10. **Legs.** Your thighs, your knees, your calves — all heavy and
    warm. Sinking into the mattress...
    2-3 breaths.

11. **Feet.** The soles of your feet. Your toes. Let them be completely
    at rest...
    2-3 breaths.

12. **Whole body.** Now feel your entire body as one — heavy, warm,
    held by the bed. Breathing happens on its own. Nothing to do.
    Nothing to fix. Just this.
    Several breaths.

**What you might notice:**
- Some areas hold more tension than others — this is information,
  not a problem
- Warmth or heaviness in areas you've scanned — a natural relaxation
  response
- Your mind wandering — completely normal. Gently return to wherever
  you left off, or simply feel the whole body
- Drowsiness — welcome it. If you fall asleep during the scan,
  the practice has done its work

### Phase 3: Deepening (3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
A gentle counting practice to deepen relaxation.

**How to do it:**
1. With each exhale, silently count backward from 10 to 1
2. With each number, imagine yourself sinking a little deeper into
   the bed... a little more relaxed... a little further from waking
3. If you lose count, simply pick a number that feels right and
   continue downward
4. There is no wrong way to do this

*10... sinking... 9... softening... 8... deeper... 7... warm...*
*6... heavy... 5... quiet... 4... drifting... 3... still...*
*2... almost... 1... rest...*

---

### Phase 4: Fading Out (2 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Release into sleep.

*You are here. The bed holds you. Your body knows how to sleep.*

*There is nothing left to do...*

...

*Nothing left to think about...*

...

*Only this breath...*

...

*And this one...*

...

*You may drift off whenever you're ready...*

...

...

*Good night.*

[Auto-shutoff activates — no further sound or light]

## Dream Journaling Prompt (Morning After)

**When you wake tomorrow:**

Before reaching for your phone or getting out of bed, lie still for
just a moment.

1. Notice if any images, feelings, or fragments linger from sleep
2. Reach for your journal (beside the bed) and write whatever comes
3. Even single words or vague impressions are valuable
4. Date your entry

**Today's prompt:**
> What was the feeling tone of your sleep? Did any image or moment
> stay with you upon waking?

*If nothing comes, simply write "No recall today." Dream recall
improves with practice.*

---

## Variations

### If sleep doesn't come
- Do not watch the clock
- After 20-30 minutes of wakefulness, get up quietly and do something
  calm in dim light (reading, gentle stretching) until drowsy, then
  return to bed
- Rest without sleep is still restorative
- Avoid telling yourself "I can't sleep" — reframe as "I'm resting"

### If this feels too long
- Skip the pre-sleep routine; begin at Phase 1 (Arrival)
- Do the body scan from shoulders to feet instead of full body
- Even 5 minutes of intentional winding down has value

### If you want to deepen
- Add the morning dream journaling as a daily practice
- Explore the Ayurvedic foot-oiling tradition before bed (warm sesame
  oil on soles of feet — traditionally calming)
- Try the 4-7-8 breathing pattern in Phase 1 (inhale 4 counts, hold 7,
  exhale 8)
- Extend Phase 3 with a visualization (descending a gentle staircase,
  floating on calm water)

### For different times of year
- **Winter:** Start the pre-sleep routine 15 minutes earlier (longer
  darkness supports earlier sleep onset). Ensure room is warm enough
  when getting into bed, then cool during sleep.
- **Summer:** Room-darkening curtains help. Lighter bedding. The routine
  may start later with longer daylight.

## Evidence Box

> **What research suggests:** Multicomponent sleep hygiene interventions
> improve sleep quality in non-clinical populations (Murawski et al.,
> 2018, meta-analysis). Body scan meditation, as part of
> mindfulness-based programs, has been associated with improved sleep
> quality in older adults (Black et al., 2015, JAMA Internal Medicine,
> n=49, RCT). Stimulus control — using the bed for sleep only and
> leaving bed when unable to sleep — has strong evidence as a component
> of CBT-I (Bootzin & Epstein, 2011).
>
> **Limitations:** Most sleep hygiene studies have moderate effect sizes.
> Body scan meditation studies for sleep are often small (n<100) and
> focused on specific populations. For chronic insomnia, CBT-I (full
> protocol) is significantly more effective than sleep hygiene education
> alone.
>
> **Traditional context:** The evening routine structure draws from
> Ayurvedic *dinacharya* (Charaka Samhita, c. 200 BCE), which prescribes
> evening practices including warm milk, foot oiling, and prayer for
> promoting restful sleep. The body scan approach has roots in yoga
> nidra (yogic sleep) traditions and was adapted into Western clinical
> practice through progressive muscle relaxation (Jacobson, 1930s) and
> mindfulness-based stress reduction (Kabat-Zinn, 1990).

*This practice draws from Ayurvedic daily routine traditions (Charaka
Samhita, c. 200 BCE), progressive relaxation methods (Jacobson, 1930s),
and contemporary behavioral sleep medicine. We acknowledge the lineages
that have preserved sleep wisdom across cultures and centuries.*

*This practice supports but does not replace medical care. If you
experience persistent sleep difficulties, consult a sleep medicine
specialist. CBT-I is the recommended first-line treatment for chronic
insomnia.*
