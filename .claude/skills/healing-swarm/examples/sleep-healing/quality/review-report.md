- [x] Red flag symptoms with clear "stop" instructions
- [x] No claims of curing sleep disorders

## Psychological Safety Review

### Checklist

- [x] Permission-based language throughout ("allow," "invite," "when ready")
- [x] No commands to relax or sleep
- [x] Exit ramp provided ("open eyes, feel feet, normal breaths")
- [x] "Rest without sleep is restorative" framing present
- [x] No performance pressure (no target times, no "success" metrics)
- [x] Mind wandering normalized
- [x] Grounding instructions for distressing imagery
- [x] Dream journaling framed as optional, subjective, no authoritative interpretation

### Notes
- The "nothing to do, nothing to fix" phrasing is excellent for
  reducing performance anxiety around sleep.
- "If you fall asleep during the scan, the practice has done its work"
  appropriately removes the implicit demand to stay awake.
- Clock-watching avoidance addressed in variations section.

## Cultural Attribution Review

### Checklist

- [x] Progressive muscle relaxation attributed (Jacobson, 1930s)
- [x] Behavioral sleep medicine traditions acknowledged (1970s-present)
- [x] No exoticizing language ("ancient secrets," "mystical")
- [x] Adaptations acknowledged honestly
- [x] Gratitude expressed to tradition holders

### Notes
- Attribution is specific and respectful.
- The practice does not claim to be an authentic Ayurvedic treatment
  but acknowledges the tradition it draws from.

## Evidence Honesty Review

### Checklist

- [x] Evidence levels stated clearly (strong, moderate, preliminary)
- [x] Specific studies cited with sample sizes
- [x] Limitations noted (small samples, specific populations)
- [x] CBT-I acknowledged as gold standard for chronic insomnia
- [x] "Suggests" language used (not "proves" or "demonstrates")
- [x] Traditional use distinguished from clinical evidence
- [x] No overclaiming on sleep outcomes

### Notes
- Evidence box is thorough and honest.
- The distinction between sleep hygiene (strong for components) and
  meditation for sleep (moderate) is correctly drawn.

  clinical insomnia.

## Recommendations for Future Versions

1. Consider creating an audio recording of this practice with
   professional voice talent and progressive volume fade.
2. Develop a companion practice for middle-of-night waking (a common
   concern not fully addressed by this protocol).
3. Consider a seasonal variation set (winter and summer versions with
   adjusted timing and environment guidance).
4. The dream journaling prompt could be expanded into a standalone
   dream journaling practice guide.
