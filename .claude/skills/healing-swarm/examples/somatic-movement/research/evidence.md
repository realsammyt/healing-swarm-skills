## Evidence Summary

| Claim | Evidence Level | Key Studies | Assessment |
|-------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Qigong/tai chi improves balance | Strong | Jahnke 2010 (meta), Wayne 2012 (RCT) | Multiple RCTs, replicated |
| Qigong/tai chi reduces fall risk | Strong | Wayne 2012, Li 2005 | RCTs in older adults, clinically significant |
| Qigong/tai chi reduces anxiety/depression | Moderate | Wang 2014 (systematic review) | Multiple RCTs, varied protocols |
| Qigong improves quality of life | Moderate | Jahnke 2010 | Meta-analysis across conditions |
| Qigong improves cardiovascular markers | Moderate | Jahnke 2010 | Multiple studies, varied outcomes |
| Slow movement activates parasympathetic NS | Moderate | General physiological research | Mechanism well-understood |
| Qigong improves bone density | Preliminary | Jahnke 2010 | Included in meta-analysis, fewer studies |

**Overall assessment:** Moderate to strong evidence, particularly for
balance, fall prevention, and psychological wellbeing. Qigong and tai chi
are among the most researched mind-body practices. The evidence base
benefits from large meta-analyses and multiple independent RCTs.

comprehensive review of health benefits of qigong and tai chi." Am J
Health Promot. 2010;24(6):e1-e25.

**PMID:** 20594090

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Design | Systematic review and meta-analysis |
| Sample | 77 randomized controlled trials |
| Interventions | Qigong and tai chi (various forms) |
| Key findings | Positive effects on bone density, cardiopulmonary fitness, physical function, falls/balance, quality of life, self-efficacy, immune function, and psychological symptoms |
| Conditions studied | Cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, neurological, psychological, oncological |

**Specific findings relevant to this practice:**
- **Balance:** Multiple studies showed improved balance and reduced fall
  risk, particularly in older adults
- **Psychological wellbeing:** Reduced anxiety, depression, and stress
  across multiple trials
- **Quality of life:** Improved across multiple conditions
- **Self-efficacy:** Practitioners reported increased confidence in
  their physical abilities

**Limitations:**
- High heterogeneity across studies (different forms, durations, populations)
- Many included studies had small sample sizes
- Blinding difficult for movement interventions
- Publication bias possible
- Tai chi and qigong grouped together (distinct practices)

**Evidence language:** "A comprehensive meta-analysis of 77 RCTs
(Jahnke et al. 2010) found that qigong and tai chi practices showed
positive effects across multiple health outcomes including balance,
cardiovascular fitness, and psychological wellbeing."

Schmid CH. "Tai Chi on psychological well-being: systematic review
and meta-analysis." BMC Complement Altern Med. 2014;14:173.

**PMID:** 24886638

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Design | Systematic review and meta-analysis |
| Sample | 40 studies (including RCTs and controlled trials) |
| Intervention | Tai chi (various styles) |
| Key findings | Tai chi significantly reduced depression, anxiety, stress, and mood disturbance compared to control conditions |
| Populations | Healthy adults, older adults, people with chronic conditions |

**Specific findings:**
- **Depression:** Significant reduction compared to no intervention
  (moderate effect size)
- **Anxiety:** Significant reduction across multiple studies
- **Stress:** Reduced self-reported stress
- **Mood:** Improved general mood and psychological wellbeing

**Limitations:**
- Heterogeneous study designs and populations
- Most studies did not compare tai chi to active exercise controls
- Blinding not possible for movement interventions
- Self-reported psychological outcomes may be influenced by expectation
- Tai chi styles varied across studies

**Evidence language:** "A systematic review of 40 studies (Wang et al.
2014) suggests that tai chi practice may reduce symptoms of depression,
anxiety, and stress, though most studies compared to inactive controls."

Wilson NL. "Tai chi and fall reductions in older adults: a randomized
controlled trial." J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2005;60(2):187-194.

**PMID (Li et al.):** 15814861

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Design | Randomized controlled trial |
| Sample | n=256, adults aged 70-92 |
| Intervention | Tai chi (60 min, 3x/week, 6 months) vs. stretching control |
| Key findings | Tai chi group had 55% fewer falls. Improved functional balance, physical performance, and reduced fear of falling |
| Follow-up | Effects maintained at 6-month follow-up |

**Limitations:**
- Single-site study
- Stretching control (not true inactive control)
- Self-reported falls (subject to recall bias)
- Participants who completed 6 months may differ from dropouts
- Intensive schedule (3x/week) may not reflect casual practice

**Additional supporting evidence:**
Wayne PM, et al. Arch Intern Med. 2012;172(10):731-738. PMID: 22025508
- RCT, n=195, community-dwelling older adults
- Tai chi 2x/week for 24 weeks
- Reduced falls, improved balance confidence

**Evidence language:** "Research demonstrates that tai chi practice
significantly reduces fall risk in older adults. A major RCT (Li et al.
2005, n=256) found 55% fewer falls in the tai chi group compared to
stretching control over 6 months."

## Evidence Gaps

### What We Know
- Tai chi and qigong improve balance and reduce fall risk (strong evidence)
- These practices reduce anxiety and depression symptoms (moderate evidence)
- HRV improvements suggest parasympathetic activation (moderate evidence)
- Low adverse event rates — practices are generally safe (strong evidence)
- Benefits seen across diverse populations (older adults, chronic conditions)

### What We Don't Know
- Optimal dose (frequency, duration, intensity) for specific outcomes
- Whether qigong and tai chi produce different outcomes
- Which specific movements or elements produce which benefits
- Long-term outcomes beyond 6-12 months
- How home practice compares to instructor-led practice
- Whether simplified/adapted forms produce similar benefits to traditional forms
- Mechanism specificity (is it the movement, the breath, the attention, or the combination?)

### What We Should Not Claim
- That qigong cures specific diseases
- That *qi* flow has been scientifically validated
- That meridian-specific effects have been demonstrated
- That qigong replaces physical therapy or medical treatment
- That any specific duration or frequency guarantees specific outcomes
- That TCM diagnostic categories have been clinically validated

## Recommended Evidence Language for This Practice

**For the gentle qigong content, use:**

> "Research on qigong and tai chi practices is substantial and growing.
> A comprehensive meta-analysis of 77 RCTs (Jahnke et al. 2010) found
> positive effects on balance, cardiovascular fitness, psychological
> wellbeing, and quality of life. Tai chi has been shown to reduce fall
> risk by 55% in older adults (Li et al. 2005, n=256). Studies also
> suggest benefits for anxiety and depression (Wang et al. 2014, 40
> studies reviewed). While the evidence base is stronger than for many
> complementary practices, most studies compare to inactive controls,
> and the specific mechanisms remain under investigation."
