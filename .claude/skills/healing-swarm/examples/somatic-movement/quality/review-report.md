## Recommendations for Future Iteration

1. **Illustrated companion:** Consider adding simple line drawings
   (text descriptions must remain primary for accessibility)
2. **Full Ba Duan Jin:** Create a 30-minute practice with all 8
   traditional movements
3. **Tai chi introduction:** Bridge practice connecting qigong
   to basic tai chi movements
4. **Outdoor practice guide:** Guidance for practicing in natural
   settings (park, garden) with grounding emphasis
5. **Integration sequence:** Practice that combines gentle qigong
   (movement) with humming (sound) and breath awareness for a
   multi-modality session
6. **Progress tracking:** Consider journal prompts that track changes
   in mobility, balance confidence, and body awareness over weeks
