# Gentle Qigong: A 15-Minute Practice

**Tradition:** Qigong (氣功), adapted from Ba Duan Jin (Traditional Chinese Medicine, c. 300 BCE)
**Duration:** 15 minutes
**Level:** Beginner (Gentle Movement / Coordinated Sequence)
**Practice Type:** Qigong — breath-synchronized gentle movement
**Positions:** Standing / Seated / Lying / Wheelchair
**Best for:** Gentle mobilization, stress relief, body awareness, nervous system regulation

---

## Overview

This is a 15-minute gentle qigong practice adapted from the Ba Duan Jin
(Eight Pieces of Brocade), one of the most widely practiced qigong forms
in the world. It combines slow, breath-synchronized movements with body
awareness to gently mobilize your joints, calm your nervous system, and
reconnect you with your body.

No prior experience, flexibility, or fitness level is required. Every
movement includes standing, seated, lying, and wheelchair modifications.
Your range of motion is always self-selected — there is no minimum.

> **Evidence note:** A comprehensive meta-analysis of 77 RCTs (Jahnke
> et al. 2010) found that qigong and tai chi practices showed positive
> effects on balance, cardiovascular fitness, psychological wellbeing,
> and quality of life. Tai chi has been shown to reduce fall risk by 55%
> in older adults (Li et al. 2005, n=256, RCT). While the evidence base
> is substantial, most studies compare to inactive controls, and the
> specific mechanisms are still under investigation.

## Tradition Attribution

This practice is adapted from qigong (氣功, "energy cultivation"), a
system of movement, breathing, and meditation from Traditional Chinese
Medicine with roots in texts dating to approximately 300 BCE (*Zhuangzi*).
The movements draw from Ba Duan Jin (八段錦, Eight Pieces of Brocade),
documented since the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) and standardized by the
Chinese Health Qigong Association (2003).

We honor the lineages that have preserved and transmitted these practices
across millennia. Our adaptation simplifies traditional forms for
accessibility — reducing the number of movements, expanding position
options, and framing through both traditional and physiological lenses —
while maintaining the core principles of breath-movement coordination
and mindful awareness.

**Open practice status:** Ba Duan Jin and general qigong practices are
open — widely taught without initiation requirement.

## Safety — Read Before Every Session

### Movement Safety
- Move **within comfort — NEVER through pain**
- If any movement causes pain, **reduce the range or skip it entirely**
- You can always **rest** — stopping is smart, not failure
- **Modify freely** — every body is different
- Stay **hydrated** — have water accessible
- If you feel **dizzy when standing**, sit down immediately

### Space
- Enough room to extend your arms in all directions (for standing)
- Non-slip surface recommended (bare feet or non-slip shoes)
- Chair with firm seat and no wheels (for seated practice)
- Mat or comfortable surface (for lying practice)

### Consult Your Healthcare Provider If You Have:
- Recent surgery or acute injury
- Severe osteoporosis
- Uncontrolled cardiovascular condition
- Acute disc herniation
- Balance disorders (practice seated or with wall support)
- Pregnancy (modify — no prone, no deep twists)
- Any condition your provider has advised against gentle movement

### Stop Immediately If You Experience:
- Sharp or shooting pain
- Joint locking or giving way
- Sudden swelling
- Numbness that doesn't resolve
- Chest pain or severe shortness of breath
- Dizziness that doesn't resolve when seated

*If you have any medical conditions, consult your healthcare provider
before beginning this practice.*

---

## Before You Begin

### You'll Need
- 15 minutes of uninterrupted time
- Comfortable clothing that doesn't restrict movement
- Water nearby
- Optional: timer or app

### Choose Your Position

You can change position at any time during the practice.

| Position | Setup |
|----------|-------|
| **Standing** | Feet hip-width apart, knees soft (not locked), arms at sides |
| **Seated (chair)** | Sit toward front of chair, feet flat on floor, spine upright but relaxed |
| **Lying down** | On your back, knees bent or legs extended, arms at sides |
| **Wheelchair** | Wheels locked, feet on footrests or floor, sitting as upright as comfortable |

### Preparation
1. Choose your position
2. Take 3 natural breaths to settle
3. Brief body scan: notice how your body feels right now
4. Remind yourself: move within comfort, never through pain

---

## The Practice

### Body Scan Check-In (2 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Notice how your body feels before you begin moving.

**How to do it:**
1. Close your eyes or soften your gaze
2. Notice your feet (or wherever your body meets the surface)
3. Move your attention slowly upward: ankles, calves, knees, thighs
4. Hips, lower back, belly, chest
5. Shoulders, arms, hands
6. Neck, jaw, face
7. Notice: where feels tense? Where feels ease? Where feels numb?

*This gives you a baseline. At the end, you'll scan again to notice
what changed.*

---

### Warm-Up: Shoulder Rolls and Neck Release (2 minutes)

**Movement 1: Shoulder Rolls**

**What you'll do:**
Gently roll your shoulders to release tension.

*Standing:*
Roll your shoulders up toward your ears, back, and down in slow circles.
5 rolls backward, then 5 rolls forward.

*Seated:*
Same movement. Sit tall but relaxed. Roll your shoulders up, back, and
down. 5 backward, 5 forward.

*Lying down:*
Press your shoulders gently into the mat, then release. Repeat 5 times.
Or, if comfortable, make small shoulder circles against the surface.

*Wheelchair:*
Same as seated. Roll your shoulders up, back, and down. 5 backward,
5 forward.

**Breath:** Inhale as shoulders rise. Exhale as they roll back and down.

**Notice:** Where does the tension live in your shoulders? Does it shift
as you roll?

---

**Movement 2: Gentle Neck Release**

**What you'll do:**
Slowly and gently turn and tilt your head.

*Standing:*
Slowly turn your head to look over your right shoulder. Hold for 2
breaths. Return to center. Turn to the left. Hold for 2 breaths. Then
tilt your right ear toward your right shoulder (don't force). Hold for
2 breaths. Return. Tilt left. Hold for 2 breaths.

*Seated:*
Same movement as standing.

*Lying down:*
Slowly roll your head to the right. Hold for 2 breaths. Center. Left.
Hold for 2 breaths.

*Wheelchair:*
Same as seated. Move only as far as comfortable.

**Breath:** Exhale as you turn or tilt. Inhale as you return to center.

**Notice:** Does one side feel different from the other? No need to
make them equal — just notice.

*If any neck movement causes pain, reduce the range or skip it
entirely. The neck is sensitive — be gentle.*

---

### Core Practice: Qigong Movements (8 minutes)

**Movement 3: Lifting the Sky (2 minutes)**

*Adapted from Ba Duan Jin movement 1: "Two Hands Hold Up the Sky"*

**What you'll do:**
Raise your arms overhead with your inhale, lower them with your exhale.

*Standing:*
1. Begin with hands at your sides, palms facing down
2. Inhale: slowly float your arms out to the sides and up overhead,
   palms turning to face the ceiling as they rise
3. At the top, palms face the sky, fingers pointing toward each other
   (don't strain — reach only as high as comfortable)
4. Exhale: slowly lower your arms back down to your sides
5. Repeat 5-6 times

*Seated:*
Same arm movement. Raise your arms as high as comfortable — it's fine
if they don't go all the way overhead. Lower with exhale.

*Lying down:*
Inhale: raise your arms from your sides, arcing up toward the ceiling
(or as far as comfortable). Exhale: lower them back down.

*Wheelchair:*
Same as seated. Raise arms as high as comfortable. If overhead is not
accessible, raise to shoulder height — this is equally valid.

**Breath:** Inhale as arms rise (opening, expanding). Exhale as arms
lower (releasing, settling).

**Notice:** Feel the stretch along your sides as your arms lift. Notice
the sense of expansion on the inhale and grounding on the exhale.

---

**Movement 4: Opening the Chest (2 minutes)**

*Adapted from Ba Duan Jin movement 2: "Drawing the Bow"*

**What you'll do:**
Open your arms wide to stretch the chest, then return to center.

*Standing:*
1. Bring your hands together in front of your chest, palms facing you
2. Inhale: open your arms out to the sides, squeezing your shoulder
   blades gently together. Palms face forward. Only go as wide as
   comfortable
3. Exhale: bring your hands back together in front of your chest
4. Repeat 5-6 times

*Seated:*
Same arm movement. Focus on the opening of the chest and the gentle
squeeze between your shoulder blades.

*Lying down:*
Start with arms crossed over your chest. Inhale: open arms out to the
sides (resting them on the mat if they reach). Exhale: bring them back
to cross over your chest.

*Wheelchair:*
Same as seated. Open as wide as comfortable. The chest opening is the
key element.

**Breath:** Inhale to open (chest expands). Exhale to close (return
to center).

**Notice:** Feel the front of your chest opening. Notice the space
between your shoulder blades. Does the opening feel different on
different breaths?

---

**Movement 5: Waist Turns (2 minutes)**

**What you'll do:**
Gently rotate your torso side to side.

*Standing:*
1. Stand with feet hip-width apart, knees soft
2. Let your arms hang loosely at your sides
3. Slowly rotate your torso to the right, letting your arms swing
   gently with the movement
4. Rotate to the left
5. Continue turning side to side at a comfortable pace — your arms
   should feel heavy and relaxed, swinging with momentum
6. Repeat 8-10 turns total (4-5 each side)

*Seated:*
Place your hands on your thighs. Slowly rotate your torso to the right,
then to the left. Only turn as far as comfortable. Keep your hips
facing forward — the rotation happens in your waist and ribcage.

*Lying down:*
Bend your knees with feet flat on the surface. Gently drop both knees
to the right (only as far as comfortable). Return to center. Drop to
the left. Repeat 4-5 times each side.

*Wheelchair:*
Same as seated. Hands on thighs or armrests. Rotate gently from the
waist, only as far as comfortable.

**Breath:** Exhale as you turn. Inhale as you return through center.

**Notice:** Feel the gentle wringing in your mid-back. Notice if one
side has more range than the other — this is normal.

*If spinal rotation causes any pain, reduce the range significantly
or skip this movement entirely.*

---

**Movement 6: Cloud Hands (2 minutes)**

*Classic tai chi / qigong movement*

**What you'll do:**
Shift your weight side to side while floating your hands in gentle arcs.

*Standing:*
1. Stand with feet slightly wider than hip-width
2. Shift your weight onto your right foot
3. Float your right hand up (palm facing you, at face height)
   while your left hand drifts down (palm facing the ground, at
   waist height)
4. Slowly shift your weight to the left foot
5. As you shift, your left hand rises and your right hand lowers —
   like your hands are gently tracing circles in front of you
6. Continue for 5-6 cycles, flowing from side to side

*Seated:*
Keep your feet on the floor. Shift your weight slightly in the chair
(or simply focus on the arm movements). Float one hand up as the other
drifts down, alternating with your breath.

*Lying down:*
Arms at your sides. Slowly raise your right arm while pressing your
left arm gently into the mat. Alternate. Focus on the sensation of
weight shifting between your arms.

*Wheelchair:*
Focus on the arm movement. Float one hand up (palm toward you) as the
other drifts down (palm toward the ground). Alternate with your breath.

**Breath:** Inhale as one hand rises. Exhale as it lowers and the other
begins to rise. Find a gentle, flowing rhythm.

**Notice:** Feel the weight shifting through your body (standing) or
the flowing quality of your arms (all positions). This movement is
meant to feel like clouds drifting.

---

### Cool-Down: Returning to Stillness (2 minutes)

**Movement 7: Rising and Sinking**

**What you'll do:**
Simple up-and-down movement to close the active practice.

*Standing:*
1. Inhale: rise slightly onto the balls of your feet while floating
   your arms up to shoulder height (palms down)
2. Exhale: sink your heels back down while lowering your arms
3. Repeat 3-4 times, each time slower than the last
4. On the final exhale, let your arms rest at your sides and stand
   in stillness

*Seated:*
Inhale: raise your arms to shoulder height. Exhale: lower them to your
lap. Repeat 3-4 times, each time slower.

*Lying down:*
Inhale: gently press your palms into the surface. Exhale: release
completely. Repeat 3-4 times.

*Wheelchair:*
Same as seated. Raise and lower arms with breath, each time slower.

**Breath:** Inhale to rise/lift. Exhale to sink/lower. Let each
repetition be slower and softer than the last.

**Notice:** Feel the settling. Each repetition is an invitation to
arrive more fully in your body.

---

### Closing: Body Scan and Grounding (1 minute)

**What you'll do:**
Return to stillness and notice what changed.

**How to do it:**
1. Stand, sit, or lie in stillness
2. Take 3 natural breaths
3. Scan your body again — the same scan you did at the beginning
4. Notice: what changed? What softened? What feels different?
5. Feel the weight of your body on the surface beneath you
6. Wiggle your fingers and toes
7. When ready, open your eyes
8. **If you were lying down or seated: stand up slowly**
9. Drink some water

**What you might notice:**
- Areas that feel warmer, looser, or more alive than before
- Greater awareness of your body's inner landscape
- A sense of calm or gentle energy
- Or: nothing dramatic — that's completely valid

*Take a gentle moment. Your body just did meaningful, quiet work.*

## Contraindications Detail

| Movement | Avoid If | Modify To |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Neck release | Recent neck injury, cervical stenosis | Very small range, or skip |
| Lifting the sky | Shoulder impingement, rotator cuff injury | Below shoulder height |
| Opening the chest | Recent chest surgery, acute rib injury | Very small range, or skip |
| Waist turns | Acute disc issue, severe osteoporosis | Reduce range, or do lying knee drops |
| Cloud hands | Severe balance disorder (standing version) | Seated arm movements only |
| Rising and sinking | Foot/ankle injury, severe balance disorder | Seated arm raises only |

---

## Variations

### If this feels too intense
- Reduce range of motion for every movement
- Skip any movement that doesn't feel right
- Do the body scan and warm-up only (5 minutes)
- Rest between movements as long as needed
- Shorten to 10 minutes

### If you want to deepen the practice
- Extend hold times (8-10 breaths per movement)
- Add additional Ba Duan Jin movements (explore the full 8)
- Practice outdoors for grounding benefit
- Slow down further — twice as long for each movement
- Combine with humming or toning practice afterward
- Extend to 20-30 minutes

### For chronic pain
- Start with body scan only
- Micro-movements: smallest possible range of motion
- Focus on areas that feel good, not areas in pain
- Lying-down position may be most comfortable
- 5 minutes, 3 times daily rather than one 15-minute session

### For different times of day
- **Morning:** Slightly more vigorous, include all movements
- **Midday:** 5-minute version — shoulder rolls, lifting the sky, waist turns
- **Evening:** Slower, gentler, more time in stillness

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Suggestion |
|-------|------------|
| Pain during a movement | Reduce range immediately. If pain persists, skip that movement. Pain is a boundary, not a challenge |
| Can't balance during cloud hands | Use a wall or chair back for support. Or practice the arm movements only, seated |
| Feeling emotional | Normal. Movement can release stored tension. Pause, ground yourself, then continue or stop |
| Joints cracking | Generally normal for gentle movements. If accompanied by pain, reduce range |
| Too stiff for the movements | Every range of motion is valid. Move 1 inch if that's available. Stiffness decreases over weeks |
| Dizzy when standing up | Stand slowly. Pause halfway. This is common after any floor or seated practice |
| Don't feel anything | Fine. Body awareness builds over weeks. Focus on the movements, not the sensations |
| Falling asleep during body scan | Your body needs rest. Allow it. Or try seated rather than lying |

---

## Journal Prompt

After your practice, you might reflect on:

- How did your body feel before the practice? How does it feel now?
- Which movements felt most comfortable or enjoyable?
- Were there areas of your body you noticed for the first time?
- What was the quality of your breathing during the practice?

*Journaling is optional. There is no requirement to report a particular
experience.*

---

## Building a Practice

**Frequency:** 3-5 times per week. Daily is ideal. Even 5 minutes of
gentle movement counts. Consistency matters more than duration.

**Timeline:** Allow 1-2 weeks to learn the movements. Balance and
mobility typically improve noticeably within 3-4 weeks of regular
practice. Body awareness deepens continuously.

**Progression:**
- Week 1-2: Learn this sequence. Focus on breath-movement coordination
- Week 3-4: Extend hold times. Explore range of motion gradually
- Month 2+: Add remaining Ba Duan Jin movements, or explore tai chi
- Ongoing: Deepen awareness, practice outdoors, seek a qualified teacher

## Background

### About Qigong and Ba Duan Jin

Qigong (氣功, "energy cultivation") is a system of coordinated movement,
breathing, and meditation from Traditional Chinese Medicine. Its roots
trace to references in the *Zhuangzi* (c. 300 BCE) and illustrated
exercise charts found in the Mawangdui tomb (168 BCE).

Ba Duan Jin (八段錦, Eight Pieces of Brocade) is one of the most widely
practiced qigong forms. Attributed in folk tradition to General Yue Fei
(12th century CE), it was documented during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE)
and standardized by the Chinese Health Qigong Association in 2003. The
eight movements are designed to target different organ systems and energy
pathways in the Traditional Chinese Medicine framework.

### Key Research

- **Jahnke et al. (2010)** — Comprehensive meta-analysis of 77 RCTs on
  qigong and tai chi. Positive effects on balance, cardiovascular
  fitness, psychological wellbeing, and quality of life.
- **Li et al. (2005)** — RCT, n=256, adults aged 70-92. Tai chi reduced
  falls by 55% over 6 months compared to stretching control.
- **Wang et al. (2014)** — Systematic review of 40 studies. Tai chi
  significantly reduced depression, anxiety, and stress.

*Note: The evidence base for qigong and tai chi is substantial and growing.
Most studies compare to inactive controls. The specific mechanisms —
movement, breath, attention, or their combination — are still under
investigation.*

*This practice is adapted from qigong (氣功), a system of movement,
breathing, and meditation from Traditional Chinese Medicine (c. 300 BCE),
drawing specifically from Ba Duan Jin (Eight Pieces of Brocade,
Song Dynasty, 960-1279 CE). The modern standardized form was developed
by the Chinese Health Qigong Association (2003). We honor the lineages
that have preserved these practices across millennia.*

*This practice complements but does not replace medical care, physical
therapy, or prescribed exercise programs. Consult your healthcare
provider before beginning any new movement practice.*
