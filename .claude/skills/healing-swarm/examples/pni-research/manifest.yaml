name: pni-meditation-immune-function
description: >
  PNI research session exploring the psychoneuroimmunological mechanisms
  by which meditation practices may affect immune function. Covers HPA axis
  modulation, vagal tone enhancement, telomere biology, NK cell activity,
  and inflammatory marker changes.

type: research
agent: pni-researcher

topic: "How does meditation affect immune function?"

outputs:
  - type: pni-brief
    path: research/pni-brief.md
    description: >
      Full PNI mechanism brief covering meditation and immune function,
      with traditional parallels, honest limitations, and practical
      implications.

  - type: practice-mapping
    path: research/practice-mapping.md
    description: >
      Maps six healing practices (WHM breathwork, loving-kindness meditation,
      yoga, tai chi, guided imagery, expressive writing) to their documented
      PNI pathways with evidence levels and key citations.
