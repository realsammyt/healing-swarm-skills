## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Evidence Honesty — PASS

**Check:**
- [x] Pennebaker & Beall (1986) founding study cited with PMID
- [x] Both meta-analyses cited (Smyth 1998, Frattaroli 2006)
- [x] Effect sizes provided (d = 0.075 to 0.47 range)
- [x] "200+ studies" claim is accurate
- [x] "Suggests" language used, not "proves"
- [x] Individual variation explicitly noted
- [x] Limitations of self-guided vs. therapist-supported noted
- [x] Publication bias acknowledged in research background

**Assessment:** Evidence framing is thorough and honest. The practice presents both the promise and the limitations of the research without overclaiming.

### 2. Temporary Distress Warning — PASS

**This is critical for Pennebaker-based practices.**

**Locations where warning appears:**
- [x] Important Notice section: "Research shows that you may feel temporarily worse immediately after a writing session"
- [x] Day 2 after-writing guidance: "Day 2 often brings the most intensity"
- [x] "What You Might Experience" section: "Temporary increase in distress" listed
- [x] Evidence section: "writers often feel temporarily worse immediately after writing sessions"
- [x] Each day's after-writing section includes grounding and self-care

**Assessment:** The temporary distress warning is appropriately prominent. It is framed as normal, expected, and temporary -- not alarming but honest.

### 3. Process-Not-Product Framing — PASS

**Prohibited language scan:**

| Prohibited | Present? |
|-----------|:---:|
| Evaluation of writing quality | No |
| "Beautiful" or "powerful" describing output | No |
| "Good writing" or "well-written" | No |
| Product-oriented goals ("create something meaningful") | No |
| Audience-oriented language ("readers will...") | No |

**Positive framing check:**
- [x] "No writing skill is required" -- stated in Overview
- [x] "Spelling, grammar, and handwriting do not matter" -- stated in Guidelines
- [x] "The value is in the process of writing" -- stated in Overview
- [x] "What emerges on the page may surprise you" -- process-oriented
- [x] "Write what is true. That is already brave." -- closing quote

**Assessment:** Consistently process-oriented throughout. No product evaluation language detected.

### 4. Privacy — PASS

**Check:**
- [x] Dedicated Privacy Notice section
- [x] "You are not required to show it to anyone -- ever"
- [x] Right to destroy explicitly stated
- [x] Digital privacy addressed (local storage)
- [x] Ownership affirmed ("You own every word")
- [x] "This is for me. No one will read this unless I choose" -- repeated

**Assessment:** Privacy protections are among the strongest in the system, appropriate for deeply personal writing content.

### 5. Safety Architecture — PASS

**Grounding:**
- [x] Six-step grounding protocol provided
- [x] Used before each session
- [x] Used after each session
- [x] Available during writing if needed
- [x] Day 4 includes final extended grounding

**Exit ramps:**
- [x] Explicit exit ramp: "At any point during the four days, you may choose to stop"
- [x] Each day includes implicit exit: "or not at all" language
- [x] Framed positively: "There is no failure in stopping"

**Self-care guidance:**
- [x] After-writing self-care for each day
- [x] Day 2 specifically flags intensity and suggests reaching out
- [x] Final closing includes self-kindness suggestions

**Assessment:** Safety architecture is thorough and integrated naturally into the practice flow.

### 6. Four-Day Structure — PASS

**Progression check:**
- [x] Day 1: Facts (what happened) -- appropriate starting point
- [x] Day 2: Feelings (how it affects you emotionally) -- deepening
- [x] Day 3: Perspective (seeing differently) -- expansion
- [x] Day 4: Integration (what you carry forward) -- meaning-making

**Fidelity to Pennebaker method:**
- [x] 4-day structure preserved
- [x] 20-minute duration preserved (within Pennebaker's 15-20 min range)
- [x] Privacy preserved
- [x] Writing about emotional experience preserved
- [x] Continuous writing instruction preserved

**Adaptations from original:**
- [x] Progressive focus added (original was open-ended all 4 days)
- [x] Grounding added
- [x] Exit ramps added
- [x] Softer language ("significant emotional experience" vs. "most traumatic")
- [x] Adaptations clearly noted as modifications

**Assessment:** Faithful to the core Pennebaker protocol while adding appropriate safety scaffolding for a self-guided healing context.

### 7. Accessibility — PASS

**Physical:**
- [x] Voice recording alternative offered
- [x] Typing alternative offered
- [x] Dictation software mentioned
- [x] Single sentence framed as valid

**Cognitive:**
- [x] One clear prompt per day
- [x] Simple guidelines
- [x] Timer-based (reduces decision fatigue)
- [x] "Write what is true" -- simple core instruction

**Psychological:**
- [x] Inner critic addressed in guidelines and variations
- [x] Non-dominant hand suggestion for perfectionism
- [x] "I don't know what to write" as valid writing content
- [x] Shortened sessions offered (5-10 minutes)

**Assessment:** Accessible across physical, cognitive, and psychological dimensions.

## Potential Risks Assessed

### Risk: Re-traumatization through writing
**Mitigation:** Softer language than original Pennebaker protocol; grounding before and after; exit ramps; suggestion to work with therapist for grief-specific writing. Research background explicitly notes this risk.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE. Self-guided practice is inherently less supported than therapist-guided, but safety scaffolding reduces risk appropriately for an intermediate-level practice.

### Risk: Participant does not read temporary distress warning
**Mitigation:** Warning appears in four separate locations; framed prominently in Important Notice at top.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE

### Risk: Practice used instead of therapy for severe conditions
**Mitigation:** Disclaimer states practice does not replace therapy; crisis resources provided; contraindications listed in agent prompt and research files.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE

### Risk: Privacy violation (digital writing)
**Mitigation:** Privacy notice explicitly addresses digital storage; "store locally" instruction given.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE

## Recommendations

### Minor Improvements

1. **Consider adding:** A specific "Day 2 preparation" note at the start of Day 2 acknowledging it is often the most emotionally intense day.

2. **Consider adding:** A brief note about what to do if the practice surfaces memories of abuse or violence (refer to a professional, do not continue self-guided).

3. **For future development:** A paired version (writing with a trusted person present, not reading each other's work) could be developed in collaboration with the community-facilitator agent.

### No Blocking Issues

This practice meets all quality gates for expressive healing content. No blocking issues identified.
