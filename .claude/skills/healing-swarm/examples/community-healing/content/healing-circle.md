# Simple Healing Circle: A Practice of Shared Presence

**Group Size:** 6-8 people
**Facilitator Required:** Yes
**Setting:** Quiet room, chairs or cushions arranged in a circle
**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Difficulty:** Introductory
**Materials:** A talking piece (any meaningful object), timer, water, tissues

---

## Overview

This is a simple, 45-minute healing circle for 6-8 people meeting with a trained facilitator. The circle creates a structured space for shared presence, deep listening, and the experience of being witnessed. Participants will sit in circle, practice shared silence, and have the opportunity (never the obligation) to speak about what they are carrying.

This is a contemplative community practice, not therapy. There is no diagnosis, no advice, no fixing. There is simply a circle of people being present with each other.

> **Note:** This healing circle REQUIRES a trained facilitator. These are not self-running practices. A facilitator experienced with group dynamics and contemplative practices is essential for safety and for holding the container.

> **Evidence note:** Social support is one of the strongest predictors of health outcomes. A meta-analysis of 148 studies (N = 308,849) found that people with stronger social relationships had a 50% greater likelihood of survival compared to those with weaker social ties (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010). Group-based interventions are well-supported for a wide range of conditions (Burlingame et al., 2004). The specific format of a healing circle has less direct clinical evidence, but the principles of shared presence, deep listening, and communal support are well-established.

## Tradition Attribution

This healing circle draws respectfully from multiple traditions:

- **Talking circle principles** (Indigenous traditions): The use of a talking piece, equal voice, deep listening, and circular arrangement. We acknowledge that talking circles are living, owned traditions of Indigenous peoples. This practice is *inspired by* these principles with gratitude; it is not an Indigenous ceremony. We defer to Indigenous practitioners and communities for authentic talking circle practice.

- **Quaker meeting** (Society of Friends, est. 1650s CE, England): The tradition of gathered silence, where the group sits together in stillness and speech arises only from inner conviction. The principle that silence itself is the practice.

- **Buddhist Sangha** (community of practitioners): The understanding that practice in community supports and stabilizes individual practice. Thich Nhat Hanh's engaged Sangha model: community as practice, not merely context for practice.

- **Ubuntu philosophy** (Southern African, Nguni Bantu): "I am because we are" -- the understanding that individual wellbeing is inseparable from communal wellbeing. A philosophical lens for why group healing works.

- **12-Step traditions** (Alcoholics Anonymous, 1935+): The sharing model of personal testimony without crosstalk or advice, anonymity, and confidentiality.

*We honor each tradition's distinct context and purpose. This circle is a modern adaptation drawing on shared principles across these traditions.*

## Facilitator Preparation

### Before the Circle

**Space setup (15 minutes before participants arrive):**
1. Arrange 6-8 chairs (or cushions) in a circle, evenly spaced
2. Ensure all participants will be able to see each other
3. Place the talking piece in the center of the circle (on a small table, cloth, or directly on the floor)
4. Have water and tissues accessible but not conspicuous
5. Ensure a quiet adjacent space is available (for anyone who needs to step out)
6. Remove or cover screens and distractions
7. Adjust lighting to warm, not harsh

**Materials:**
- A talking piece: any meaningful object that can be held and passed (a stone, a shell, a wooden piece, a feather -- choose something that feels substantial enough to hold)
- This protocol (for reference)
- Timer or watch
- Water for all participants
- Tissues

**Personal preparation (10 minutes):**
1. Complete your own centering practice: sit in the circle space, breathe, ground yourself
2. Review this full protocol
3. Set your intention: "I am here to hold space. I will not participate in the practice. My groundedness sets the tone."
4. Prepare for scenarios: What will you do if someone becomes very distressed? If someone gives unsolicited advice? If no one speaks during sharing? (Answers below in facilitation notes.)

## Group Consent

### When Participants Arrive

Welcome each person warmly. Allow informal settling (2-3 minutes). When everyone is seated in the circle, begin.

### Consent Script

**Facilitator says:**

"Welcome. Thank you for being here.

Before we begin, I want to be clear about what this involves and what your rights are.

For the next 45 minutes, we will sit in this circle together. We will practice shared silence. There will be an opportunity to speak about what you are carrying, using a talking piece -- but speaking is never required. Listening is a full form of participation.

This is a contemplative practice, not therapy. I am a facilitator, not a therapist. I hold the space and the time; I do not direct your experience.

**Your rights in this circle:**

- You may pass on any sharing prompt. Simply hold the talking piece for a moment, then pass it on. No explanation needed.
- You may leave at any time. No explanation needed.
- What you share here stays here. Confidentiality is everyone's responsibility.
- You own your experience. No one will interpret, evaluate, or advise on what you share.
- You may ask for what you need at any time.
- Physical boundaries: no uninvited touch.

If you feel distressed at any point, place the talking piece down or raise your hand, and I will step aside with you.

Does everyone consent to participate under these guidelines?"

*[Wait for explicit verbal consent from EACH participant. Look at each person. A nod is acceptable if accompanied by eye contact, but verbal is preferred.]*

*[If anyone does not consent: "You are welcome to observe silently, or to leave. Either choice is respected." No further discussion.]*

---

## Confidentiality Agreement

**Facilitator says:**

"Before we enter the circle, we make an agreement together.

**What stays in the circle:**
- Other people's stories and experiences
- Who said what
- Personal details shared by others
- Anything you would not want shared about yourself

**What you MAY share outside:**
- Your own experience and feelings
- General impressions: 'It was meaningful' or 'I found it helpful'
- That you participated, if you choose

This is not a rule I am imposing. It is an agreement we make together. Confidentiality is what makes this space safe enough for honesty.

Can everyone commit to this?"

*[Wait for explicit verbal agreement from each participant.]*

---

## Circle Opening (5 minutes)

### Shared Grounding

**Facilitator says:**

"Let's begin by arriving here together.

If you're comfortable, close your eyes. If you prefer, let your gaze rest softly on the floor in front of you.

...

Feel your feet on the ground. Press them gently into the floor. Notice the surface beneath you -- how it holds your weight.

...

Take a breath. Not a special breath. Just a breath.

...

And another.

...

Notice the room. The temperature. The quality of the light. The presence of the other people in this circle. You do not need to do anything with that awareness. Just notice.

...

One more breath together.

...

When you're ready, gently open your eyes."

### Intention

**Facilitator says:**

"We are here to practice something simple and ancient: being present with each other. There is nothing you need to do, say, or perform. Your presence is your contribution.

For the next 45 minutes, this circle is a container. What we bring into it -- our attention, our silence, our words if we choose them -- that is the practice."

### Guidelines

**Facilitator says:**

"A few guidelines that protect everyone in this space:

1. **Speak from 'I'**: Share your own experience. 'I feel...' 'I noticed...' 'I am carrying...'
2. **Listen without fixing**: When someone speaks, simply receive what they share. No advice, no comparison, no interpretation. Just listen.
3. **Pass freely**: When the talking piece comes to you, you may speak or you may pass. Both are full participation.
4. **One voice**: When someone holds the talking piece, they have the floor. Everyone else listens.
5. **Confidentiality**: As we agreed.
6. **Respect time**: Be mindful of sharing time so all voices can be heard. I will gently signal if we need to move on.

These guidelines are not restrictions. They are the container that makes depth possible."

## Core Practice (30 minutes)

### Phase 1: Shared Silence (5 minutes)

**Facilitator says:**

"We begin with silence. For the next five minutes, we will simply sit together. You do not need to meditate, pray, or do anything in particular. Simply be here, in the presence of these other people.

If your mind wanders, that is natural. If emotions arise, let them. If nothing arises, let that be.

I will ring the bell [or signal] when five minutes have passed."

*[Five minutes of silence. Facilitator monitors for distress but does not intervene unless needed.]*

*[Signal the end of silence with a gentle bell, tone, or spoken word.]*

---

### Phase 2: Talking Piece Round -- "What You Are Carrying" (20 minutes)

**Facilitator says:**

"Now, if you are willing, we will pass the talking piece around the circle.

When the piece comes to you, you are invited to share one thing you are carrying today. It might be a feeling, a concern, a gratitude, a question, a weight, a hope. It does not need to be dramatic or articulate. A few words are enough. Silence is also enough -- you may hold the piece and pass it on.

I will not be sharing. I hold the space.

There is no right answer. There is no performance. Whatever you bring -- or don't bring -- is welcome here."

*[Pick up the talking piece. Hand it to the person to your left (or right -- be consistent).]*

**Facilitation notes during the round:**

- **If someone speaks at length (more than 3 minutes):** Wait for a natural pause, then gently: "Thank you. Let's pass the piece so others may share too."
- **If someone gives advice to a previous speaker:** Gently interrupt: "Thank you -- in this circle, we share our own experience rather than responding to others'. You're welcome to share what comes up for you."
- **If someone passes:** Simply nod or say "Thank you" and let the piece move on. No questions, no pressure.
- **If the circle is very quiet and most people pass:** This is valid. Silence is participation. After the round, you might say: "Sometimes the most honest thing is silence. Thank you."
- **If someone becomes emotional:** Allow it. Do not rush to comfort or fix. If they seem in significant distress, make eye contact and quietly ask: "Would you like to continue, or would you like to step out with me for a moment?"
- **If the talking piece goes around and there is time remaining:** You may offer a second round: "If anyone would like to add something, we can pass the piece again." This is optional.

---

### Phase 3: Closing Silence (5 minutes)

**Facilitator says:**

"Thank you for what was shared -- and what was held in silence.

Let's close with a few minutes of shared silence. Simply sit with what is here. Notice what you are carrying now -- whether it has shifted or stayed the same.

...

You don't need to resolve anything. You don't need to take anything away. Simply be here, in the company of these people who showed up with you today."

*[Five minutes of silence.]*

*[Signal the end with a gentle bell or spoken word.]*

---

## Circle Closing (10 minutes)

### Closing Round (Optional, 5 minutes)

**Facilitator says:**

"We are coming to the close of our circle. If you would like, you may share one word -- just one word -- about what you are carrying away from this time. Or you may pass."

*[Pass the talking piece around. One word each. Do not comment on anyone's word.]*

### Confidentiality Reminder

**Facilitator says:**

"As we leave this circle, remember: your experience is yours to carry. Others' experiences stay here. Thank you for your trust and your honesty."

### Grounding and Re-Entry

**Facilitator says:**

"Before you stand, take a moment to ground yourself.

Feel your feet on the floor. Take a breath. Look around the room -- notice the ordinary reality of this space. The chairs. The light. The people.

When you are ready, you may stand and move gently. There is no rush to return to your day. If you can, take a few minutes of quiet before re-entering the world."

---

## Debrief

### For Participants (Optional, 5 minutes after closing)

If the group seems to want it, you may offer a brief debrief:

"Is there anything anyone wants to name before we go?"

**Guidelines:**
- Keep it brief
- No evaluating or comparing experiences
- No interpreting what others shared
- "I noticed..." language

**If no one speaks:** "That's perfectly fine. Thank you for being here." Close the session.

### For Facilitator (Private, After Participants Leave)

Sit in the circle space alone for 2-3 minutes. Then ask yourself:
- What went well?
- What was challenging?
- Was anyone in distress? Do they need follow-up?
- Were any guidelines tested? How was it handled?
- How am I feeling right now?
- Do I need grounding or support?

---

## Facilitator Self-Care

**You absorbed the emotional energy of 6-8 people. Self-care is required, not optional.**

### Immediately After
1. Sit in the circle space alone for 2-3 minutes
2. Run your own grounding: feet on floor, three breaths, name three things you see
3. Drink water
4. If co-facilitating, debrief with your partner

### Within 24 Hours
- Do something restorative (walk, rest, time with someone you trust)
- Notice if you are carrying anything from the circle
- Journal if helpful
- Reach out to a peer facilitator if anything felt heavy

## Evidence

> **What research suggests:** Social support is one of the strongest predictors of health outcomes across conditions. A meta-analysis of 148 studies (N = 308,849) found that stronger social relationships were associated with 50% greater survival likelihood (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010). Social isolation and loneliness significantly increase mortality risk (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015). Group-based interventions show effectiveness comparable to individual therapy for many conditions (Burlingame et al., 2004).

>
> **Note:** The evidence for social support and group-based interventions is very strong. The specific format of a healing circle (as distinct from other group formats) has less direct clinical evidence. This circle applies well-established principles of social support, deep listening, and shared presence in a structured, facilitated format.

## Contraindications for Group Settings

**This circle may NOT be appropriate for:**

- Individuals in acute mental health crisis (refer to professional support)
- Individuals with active psychosis or severe dissociation
- Individuals with severe social anxiety that would make group participation distressing rather than healing (offer individual practice first)
- Situations where significant power imbalances exist between participants (employer/employee in the same circle) without adequate safeguards
- Individuals who are actively intoxicated

**When in doubt:** Individual practice first. Group practice when the person is stable, willing, and has some experience with contemplative practice.

---

## Variations

### For smaller groups (3-4 people)
- Shorten to 30 minutes
- The sharing round can be more intimate -- allow slightly longer per person
- The facilitator role is still important even in small groups

### For larger groups (10-12 people)
- Extend to 60 minutes
- Consider a co-facilitator
- The sharing round may need a gentle time guideline ("about 2 minutes each")
- Alternatively: split into two circles of 5-6 for the sharing round, then reconvene for closing

### For online/virtual circles
- Camera on is invited but not required
- Mute when not speaking (talking piece = unmuting)
- Use chat for "pass" if preferred
- Shorter duration (30-35 minutes -- screen fatigue is real)
- Consent and confidentiality still required

### For specific themes
- **Grief circle:** Add crisis resources; extend silence; use the grief-practice template for additional safety
- **Gratitude circle:** Sharing prompt: "What are you grateful for today?"
- **Transition circle:** For groups experiencing shared change (retirement, relocation, illness)
- **Intention circle:** New year, new season, new chapter -- sharing what you are moving toward

### If the circle goes quiet
- Silence is valid. Do not panic.
- After the first round, you might say: "The silence in this circle is also a form of participation. Thank you."
- Do not fill silence with activity or prompts unless the energy is clearly stuck
- If truly stuck: "Would anyone like to share what it's like to sit in this silence?"

## Building a Practice

**For the group:**
- A single circle can be meaningful on its own
- Ongoing circles (weekly, biweekly, monthly) deepen trust and allow the group to develop
- The same group meeting regularly builds a container that allows more depth over time

**For the facilitator:**
- Seek training in group facilitation and contemplative practice
- Practice facilitating with a co-facilitator before leading alone
- Join a peer facilitator group for ongoing support
- Your own contemplative practice is essential -- you cannot hold space you have not cultivated in yourself

*This healing circle honors the community healing traditions of many cultures -- Indigenous talking circles, Quaker meeting, Buddhist Sangha, Jewish Mussar, Ubuntu philosophy, and 12-Step practice. We acknowledge with gratitude the lineages that have held space for communal healing across millennia.*

*This practice is offered as a community contemplative experience. It does not replace professional therapy, counseling, or medical care.*

---

*"We heal in relationship. The circle holds what no individual can hold alone."*
