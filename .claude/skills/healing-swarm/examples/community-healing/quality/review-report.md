## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Consent Framework — PASS

**Check:**
- [x] Full consent script provided, to be read aloud
- [x] Rights enumerated: pass, leave, confidentiality, ownership, boundaries, ask for needs
- [x] What practice is NOT stated (not therapy, no pressure)
- [x] Distress signal established (place talking piece down, raise hand)
- [x] EXPLICIT verbal consent required from EACH participant
- [x] Observation-only option offered for those who decline
- [x] No pressure on those who decline

**Assessment:** Consent framework is thorough and extends the paired practice requirements from ethics-guardrails.md to full group settings. The script is warm but complete.

### 2. Confidentiality Agreement — PASS

**Check:**
- [x] Explicit verbal agreement from all participants
- [x] Clear distinction: others' stories stay; your own experience can be shared
- [x] Framed as collective agreement ("we make together"), not imposed rule
- [x] Reminder at circle closing
- [x] Phrasing: "Confidentiality is what makes this space safe enough for honesty"

**Assessment:** Confidentiality framework is well-designed. The distinction between what stays and what can be shared is clear and practical.

### 3. Facilitator Architecture — PASS

**Check:**
- [x] Facilitator is NOT a participant (stated multiple times)
- [x] Facilitator preparation checklist (space, materials, personal)
- [x] Facilitation notes for each phase
- [x] Specific scenarios addressed:
  - [x] Someone speaks too long
  - [x] Someone gives unsolicited advice
  - [x] Someone passes
  - [x] Circle is very quiet
  - [x] Someone becomes emotional
  - [x] Someone becomes significantly distressed
- [x] Facilitator self-care section
- [x] Private debrief questions for facilitator
- [x] Co-facilitator recommended for larger groups

**Assessment:** Facilitator guidance is exceptionally detailed. The embedded facilitation notes during the sharing round are particularly well-done — they provide specific language for common scenarios rather than generic advice.

### 4. Cultural Sensitivity — PASS

**Indigenous traditions:**
- [x] Talking circles acknowledged as "living, owned traditions of Indigenous peoples"
- [x] "Inspired by" language used (not "practicing" or "offering")
- [x] "Not an Indigenous ceremony" stated explicitly
- [x] Deference to Indigenous practitioners for authentic practice
- [x] Specific sources cited (Pranis, Boyes-Watson)

**Other traditions:**
- [x] Quaker meeting: historical context, founding date
- [x] Buddhist Sangha: theological context, specific teacher (Thich Nhat Hanh)
- [x] Mussar: historical roots, Holocaust acknowledgment, revival
- [x] Ubuntu: philosophical context, Tutu quote
- [x] 12-Step: founding, specific principles
- [x] No conflation between traditions; each presented distinctly

**Assessment:** Cultural engagement is respectful and well-contextualized. The Indigenous acknowledgment is particularly carefully handled.

### 5. Evidence Honesty — PASS

**Check:**
- [x] Social support evidence accurately cited (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010, 50% survival finding)
- [x] Sample sizes noted (N = 308,849)
- [x] Loneliness mortality evidence cited (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015)
- [x] Group therapy effectiveness cited (Burlingame et al., 2004)
- [x] PMIDs provided
- [x] CRITICAL: "The specific format of a healing circle has less direct clinical evidence" — stated honestly
- [x] "Principles of shared presence, deep listening, and communal support are well-established" — accurate framing
- [x] Individual variation not over-promised (circle is framed as community practice, not treatment)

**Assessment:** Evidence framing is among the most honest in the system. The explicit acknowledgment that the specific circle format has less direct evidence, while the underlying principles are very strong, is a model for evidence honesty.

### 6. Safety Architecture — PASS

**Distress response plan:**
- [x] Signal for distress established in consent (place piece down, raise hand)
- [x] Step-by-step response embedded in facilitation notes
- [x] Quiet adjacent space prepared
- [x] Grounding protocol available
- [x] No pressure to return to circle
- [x] Follow-up after session

**Power dynamics:**
- [x] "Every voice in this circle carries equal weight" — circle principle
- [x] Facilitator not participating
- [x] Time management to prevent one person dominating
- [x] Contraindications include employer/employee dynamics
- [x] Advice-giving addressed in guidelines and facilitation notes

**Boundaries:**
- [x] "No uninvited touch" in consent
- [x] "Speak from I" in guidelines
- [x] "Listen without fixing" in guidelines
- [x] Unsolicited advice redirection scripted

**Assessment:** Comprehensive safety architecture appropriate for group settings.

### 7. Circle Structure — PASS

**Flow check:**
- [x] Consent and confidentiality (before practice begins)
- [x] Shared grounding (5 minutes — settles the group)
- [x] Intention and guidelines (2-3 minutes)
- [x] Shared silence (5 minutes — establishes contemplative tone)
- [x] Talking piece round (20 minutes — core practice)
- [x] Closing silence (5 minutes — integration)
- [x] Closing round, one word (5 minutes — gentle transition)
- [x] Confidentiality reminder
- [x] Grounding and re-entry

**Assessment:** The structure follows a natural arc: settle, open, deepen, close. The shared silence before and after the talking round is well-designed — it creates a contemplative container rather than jumping straight into sharing.

## Potential Risks Assessed

### Risk: Scapegoating or targeting within the group
**Mitigation:** "Speak from I" guideline; "Listen without fixing" guideline; facilitator monitoring; advice-giving redirect scripted.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE for introductory level. Advanced circles may need additional safeguards.

### Risk: Pressure to share despite guidelines
**Mitigation:** Multiple statements that passing is valid; "Silence is participation"; facilitator models acceptance of passing.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE

### Risk: Re-traumatization through hearing others' experiences
**Mitigation:** This is an introductory circle; the sharing prompt is gentle ("what you are carrying"); the framing explicitly states this is not therapy and should not be used for active trauma processing. Contraindications address recent interpersonal trauma.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE with note: the contraindications section should be reviewed by the facilitator before every circle, not just once.

### Risk: Facilitator burnout
**Mitigation:** Dedicated self-care section; supervision recommended for regular facilitators; permission to take breaks.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE

### Risk: Group used as substitute for professional support
**Mitigation:** "This is a contemplative practice, not therapy" stated in consent; contraindications list acute mental health conditions; evidence section is honest about what circles can and cannot do.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE

### Risk: Cultural appropriation
**Mitigation:** Indigenous traditions acknowledged as owned; "inspired by" language; explicit statement that this is not an Indigenous ceremony; deference to Indigenous practitioners.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE. This is one of the more carefully handled cultural engagements in the system.

## Recommendations

### Minor Improvements

1. **Consider adding:** A brief note about what to do if a participant reveals active abuse, harm to self or others, or criminal activity during the circle (mandatory reporting may apply depending on facilitator's role).

2. **Consider adding:** A participant handout or guide that can be given before the circle, so people know what to expect before arriving.

3. **For future development:** A training protocol for facilitators (beyond the preparation section) would strengthen the overall safety of the community healing practice.

### No Blocking Issues

This practice meets all quality gates for community healing content. No blocking issues identified. The safety architecture is comprehensive and appropriate for an introductory healing circle.
