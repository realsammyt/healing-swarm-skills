## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Crisis Resources — PASS

**Location check:**
- [x] Present at TOP of practice (before any content)
- [x] Present at BOTTOM of practice (after closing)
- [x] 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline included
- [x] Crisis Text Line included
- [x] International resources referenced
- [x] Warm, invitational language ("You are not alone. You deserve support.")

**Assessment:** Crisis resources are prominently placed and use appropriately warm language. They do not feel clinical or buried.

### 2. Suicidal Ideation Screening — PASS

**Check:**
- [x] Grief disclaimer includes "If grief feels overwhelming" language
- [x] "When to Seek Professional Support" section includes persistent thoughts of self-harm/suicide as explicit criterion
- [x] Crisis numbers repeated in this section
- [x] Language frames seeking help as courage, not weakness

**Assessment:** Screening is integrated naturally throughout rather than appearing as a single checkbox. The tone is supportive, not alarming.

### 3. Exit Ramps — PASS

**Count and quality:**
- [x] Exit Ramp #1: After Opening, before Core Practice — "If being here is enough for today... that is complete. You may skip to the Closing section at any time. This counts. You count."
- [x] Exit Ramp #2: Midway through Core Practice — "You do not have to continue. Whatever you have done so far is enough."
- [x] Exit Ramp #3: Before Deepening section — "You may move to the Closing whenever you are ready. There is no wrong time to stop."

**Framing check:**
- [x] No exit ramp frames stopping as failure
- [x] Each exit ramp includes brief grounding cue (hand on heart, hands on thighs)
- [x] Each exit ramp directs to Closing section for proper grounding
- [x] Language is affirming: "This counts," "enough," "listening to what you need"

**Assessment:** Three exit ramps exceed minimum requirements. Framing is consistently positive and empowering. Each includes a physical grounding anchor.

### 4. Grief Language Safety — PASS

**Prohibited language scan:**

| Prohibited | Present? | Notes |
|-----------|:---:|-------|
| Grief stages referenced prescriptively | No | Background section mentions stage models only to note they are outdated |
| Timeline imposed | No | "There is no timeline" stated explicitly |
| "Moving on" / "getting over it" | No | Not present anywhere |
| Loss comparison ("at least...") | No | Not present |
| "Stay strong" | No | "You do not have to be strong right now" used instead |
| "Everything happens for a reason" | No | Not present |
| "They're in a better place" | No | Not present |
| Pathologizing normal grief | No | "Grief is not a disorder to be fixed" stated explicitly |

**Positive language check:**
- [x] "There is no wrong way to grieve" — present
- [x] All grief responses normalized (tears, anger, numbness, relief, guilt, laughter, nothing, physical sensations, confusion, longing)
- [x] "Whatever you are experiencing right now is exactly right" — present
- [x] Self-compassion language present throughout

**Assessment:** Language is exceptionally careful. No prohibited patterns found. Positive grief-informed language is woven throughout naturally.

### 5. Cultural Sensitivity — PASS

**Check:**
- [x] Traditions attributed with specificity (Buddhist, continuing bonds, mindfulness-based)
- [x] No single cultural mourning practice prescribed as "the way"
- [x] Background research acknowledges mourning practices vary across cultures
- [x] Practice is secular/adaptable — no specific spiritual framework required
- [x] Tibetan practices referenced as educational only, not instructional
- [x] Closed practices not reproduced

**Assessment:** Cultural framing is respectful and educational without being prescriptive.

### 6. Evidence Honesty — PASS

**Check:**
- [x] Evidence level accurately stated as "moderate"
- [x] Specific citations provided with dates and PMIDs
- [x] Limitations acknowledged ("Most grief intervention research involves therapist-guided treatment")
- [x] "Suggests" language used, not "proves"
- [x] Individual variation explicitly noted
- [x] Self-guided practice limitation honestly stated

**Assessment:** Evidence framing is honest and appropriately qualified. No overclaiming detected.

### 7. Tone Assessment — PASS

**Voice guide alignment:**
- [x] Sits at the DEEP end of the tone spectrum (contemplative, spacious, holding)
- [x] Short sentences with generous silence markers ("...")
- [x] More space than words
- [x] Invitational language throughout ("if you are willing," "if it feels right")
- [x] Never commanding or directive
- [x] Warm without being saccharine
- [x] Present without being intrusive

**Assessment:** Tone is the deepest on the voice-guide spectrum, as specified. The practice reads as genuinely contemplative and unhurried. Silence periods are marked with "..." and explicit "(30 seconds of silence)" / "(60 seconds of silence)" markers.

### 8. Health/Ability Loss — PASS

**Check:**
- [x] Explicitly acknowledged in Overview: "If you are grieving a change in your body, your health, or your ability..."
- [x] Variation section includes specific adaptation for health/ability loss
- [x] Body awareness section includes guidance for those with pain or physical changes
- [x] Anticipatory grief variation included

**Assessment:** Health and ability loss are treated as legitimate grief throughout, not as an afterthought.

### 9. Accessibility — PASS

**Physical:**
- [x] Can be done seated or lying down
- [x] No physical movements required
- [x] Comfort objects optional
- [x] Position adaptable to any physical condition

**Cognitive:**
- [x] Short, simple instructions
- [x] One instruction at a time
- [x] Key permissions repeated ("You may stop at any time")
- [x] Clear section markers

**Psychological:**
- [x] Maximum exit ramps
- [x] Crisis resources prominent
- [x] No pressure for any specific experience
- [x] Journal reflection explicitly marked as optional/never required

## Potential Risks Assessed

### Risk: Practice triggering suicidal ideation
**Mitigation:** Crisis resources at top and bottom; professional referral criteria explicit; exit ramps at every stage; practice designed for gentle presence, not deep emotional excavation.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE

### Risk: Practice used to avoid professional help
**Mitigation:** Clear disclaimer that practice does not replace therapy; specific criteria for when to seek professional support; language frames help-seeking as courage.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE

### Risk: Premature meaning-making
**Mitigation:** Practice is at Acknowledgment level only; meaning-making not introduced; progression notes explicitly warn against rushing to meaning.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE

### Risk: Cultural insensitivity
**Mitigation:** Practice is culturally adaptable; no specific mourning form prescribed; traditions referenced with attribution and respect.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE

### Risk: Re-traumatization
**Mitigation:** Practice is intentionally gentle (Acknowledgment, not deeper levels); extensive grounding; multiple exit ramps; body-based rather than narrative-based (avoids re-traumatization through story repetition).
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE

### Risk: Isolation reinforcement
**Mitigation:** Preparation section suggests letting someone know; social support noted in evidence; variations suggest having a trusted person nearby. Future practices should more strongly encourage community support.
**Assessment:** ADEQUATE with note for improvement

## Recommendations

### Minor Improvements

1. **Consider adding:** A brief note in the Closing about what to do if intense emotions persist after the practice ends (suggestion: use the grounding protocol, reach out to a trusted person, or call 988 if in crisis).

2. **Consider adding:** A note that this practice can be done alongside professional grief counseling, not only in its absence.

3. **For future development:** A companion practice for grief in community (connection to community-facilitator agent) would strengthen the social support dimension.

### No Blocking Issues

This practice meets all quality gates for grief content. No blocking issues identified. The enhanced safety architecture is thorough and appropriate for the highest-sensitivity healing domain.

*"The measure of a grief practice is not whether it makes grief go away. It is whether it holds space safely enough that someone is willing to return."*
