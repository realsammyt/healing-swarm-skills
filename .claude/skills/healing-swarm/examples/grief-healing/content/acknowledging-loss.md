## Important Notice

*This practice is offered as a contemplative companion for grief. It does NOT replace professional grief counseling, therapy, or medical care.*

*If grief feels overwhelming, if you are unable to function in daily life, or if grief is intensifying rather than shifting over time, please consider reaching out to a grief-specialized therapist. Seeking help is not a sign of weakness -- it is an act of courage.*

*Continue all prescribed treatments unless your healthcare provider advises otherwise.*

## Overview

This is a gentle, 15-minute practice for being present with loss. It does not try to fix, explain, or resolve your grief. It simply creates a space -- a container -- for whatever is here.

You do not need to feel anything in particular. You do not need to cry or have an insight or reach a conclusion. You simply need to be willing to sit down and be present, for as long as that feels possible.

If you are grieving a change in your body, your health, or your ability to do what you once could -- that is real grief. It deserves the same compassion and space as any other loss. You are allowed to mourn what has changed.

> **A note about grief:** Grief is not a disorder to be fixed. It is the natural response to loss -- a reflection of what mattered. This practice does not aim to take your grief away. It offers a space to be with whatever is here, for as long as feels right.

> **Evidence note:** Mindfulness-based approaches to grief show moderate evidence for supporting the grieving process (Thieleman & Cacciatore, 2014). Contemporary grief research supports being present with loss rather than avoiding it, while also respecting individual readiness and pace (Stroebe & Schut, 1999, Dual Process Model). This practice aligns with continuing bonds theory (Klass, Silverman & Nickman, 1996), which validates maintaining connection with what has been lost.

---

## Tradition Attribution

This practice draws from multiple traditions of contemplative grief support:

- **Buddhist impermanence meditation** (*Maranasati*): The tradition of sitting with the reality of change and loss, cultivated across Theravada Buddhist traditions for over 2,500 years. We draw on the principle of being present with what is, without trying to change it.

- **Continuing bonds theory** (Klass, Silverman & Nickman, 1996): Contemporary grief research that validated what many cultures have always known -- that maintaining connection with what we have lost is healthy, not pathological.

- **Mindfulness-based grief support** (contemporary): Evidence-informed approaches to being present with grief, drawing from mindfulness-based stress reduction (Kabat-Zinn, 1990) adapted for bereavement contexts.

*We honor each tradition's distinct context. This practice is a modern adaptation drawing on shared principles of presence and compassion across these frameworks.*

## Before You Begin

### Emotional Safety Preparation

1. **Choose a time** when you have no pressing obligations afterward. Give yourself at least 15 minutes beyond the practice to simply be
2. **Choose a space** where you feel safe and will not be interrupted. This can be anywhere -- a room, a garden, a parked car
3. **Let someone know** (optional): If it feels right, let a trusted person know you are doing a grief practice. You do not need to explain more than that
4. **Gather comfort objects** (optional): A blanket, a photo, an object that connects you to what you have lost, a cup of tea, a pillow to hold
5. **Know your exit**: You may stop this practice at any time. Stopping is not failure -- it is listening to what you need

### You Will Need

- 15 minutes of uninterrupted time
- A comfortable place to sit or lie down
- Optional: a comfort object, a blanket, tissues nearby

### Grounding Before You Begin

Before entering the practice, ground yourself:

1. Feel your feet on the ground -- press gently
2. Place one hand on your chest, one on your belly
3. Breathe naturally -- do not try to change your breath
4. Name three things you can see in the room
5. Say your own name aloud, gently
6. If you have a comfort object, hold it now

*Take as long as you need. There is no rush.*

## The Practice

### Opening (3 minutes)

Settle into your seat or lying position. Let your body find its own comfort. There is no correct posture for grief.

If it feels right, close your eyes. If you prefer to keep them open, let your gaze rest softly on something nearby -- the floor, your hands, a point on the wall. Either way is fine.

Take a breath. Not a special breath. Just a breath.

...

You are here. That is enough.

...

Whatever brought you to this practice -- whatever you have lost or are losing -- you do not need to name it yet. You do not need to explain it. You simply need to be here.

...

Place a hand somewhere on your body that feels comforting. Your chest. Your belly. Your knee. Your own shoulder, as if you were holding yourself.

...

Breathe.

---

### EXIT RAMP #1

*If being here is enough for today -- if simply showing up and sitting down is all you have -- that is complete. You may skip to the Closing section at any time. This counts. You count.*

---

### Core Practice: Being With What Is Here (7 minutes)

Now, gently, begin to notice what is present in your body.

You do not need to search for grief. You do not need to summon any feeling. Simply notice what is already here.

...

There may be heaviness. Tightness. A hollowness. Aching. Warmth. Numbness. Nothing at all. Whatever you find is exactly right.

...

If you notice a specific place in your body that holds something -- a constriction in your throat, a weight on your chest, a knot in your belly -- you might gently rest your attention there. Not to fix it. Just to be with it. The way you might sit beside someone who is hurting, without trying to make it better.

...

(30 seconds of silence)

...

If feelings arise, let them. Tears, anger, confusion, numbness, relief -- whatever comes is welcome here. There is no wrong response. Grief takes every shape.

...

If nothing arises, that is also welcome. Sometimes grief is quiet. That does not mean it is absent.

...

(30 seconds of silence)

...

Now, if you are willing -- and only if you are willing -- you might silently acknowledge what you have lost. You do not need to say it aloud. You do not need to tell the full story. You might simply say inwardly:

*"I have lost something that mattered."*

Or, if you know what it is:

*"I have lost ___."*

...

Let that be here. You do not need to do anything with it. Just let it be in the room with you.

...

(60 seconds of silence)

...

Notice your breath. It is still here. You are still here. Grief is visiting, and you are still here.

---

### EXIT RAMP #2

*Pause here if you need to. Place your hand on your heart. Breathe. You do not have to continue. Whatever you have done so far is enough. If you would like, move to the Closing section.*

---

### Deepening: A Moment of Compassion (optional, 2 minutes)

If you would like to stay a moment longer, you might offer yourself a few quiet words. Not to fix anything. Just as a gesture of kindness toward yourself in this moment.

You might say inwardly:

*"This is hard."*

...

*"I am allowed to grieve."*

...

*"There is no timeline for this."*

...

*"I do not have to be strong right now."*

...

Or you might simply place both hands on your heart and breathe. That is a complete act of compassion.

...

(30 seconds of silence)

---

### EXIT RAMP #3

*At any point, you may open your eyes, place both hands on your thighs, and feel their weight. You may move to the Closing whenever you are ready. There is no wrong time to stop.*

---

## What You Might Experience

**All of these are valid grief responses -- there is no wrong way to grieve:**

- **Tears** -- grief finding its way out through the body
- **Anger** -- a fierce response to what should not have happened
- **Numbness** -- the mind's way of protecting you when feeling is too much
- **Relief** -- sometimes present alongside grief, and that is not betrayal
- **Guilt** -- "I should have..." is grief's most common companion, and it does not make you a bad person
- **Laughter** -- memory sometimes brings joy; that is not disrespect
- **Nothing** -- sometimes grief is quiet. That does not mean it is absent or that you are doing this wrong
- **Physical sensations** -- heaviness, tightness, hollowness, aching, warmth, chill
- **Confusion** -- not knowing what to feel is itself a feeling
- **Longing** -- the ache of wanting what cannot be returned

*Whatever you are experiencing right now is exactly right.*

---

## Closing and Grounding (3 minutes)

Begin to draw the practice gently to a close.

You do not need to resolve anything. You do not need to feel better. You simply need to return, gently, to the present moment.

...

If your eyes are closed, keep them closed for a moment longer.

Place both hands somewhere on your body that feels comforting. Your chest. Your belly. Your thighs.

...

Feel your breath moving. Do not change it. Just feel it.

...

Notice the surface beneath you. Its texture. Its temperature. How it holds your weight. You are supported.

...

Now, slowly, open your eyes. Look at something nearby. A simple object. Notice its color, its shape.

...

Feel your feet on the ground. Press gently. The ground is still here.

...

Say to yourself, gently -- aloud or silently:

*"I am here. I showed up for my grief. That takes courage."*

...

Take your time. There is no rush to stand, to move, to return to anything. If you can, sit quietly for a few minutes. Drink some water. Be gentle with yourself.

*This practice is complete. Whatever happened here -- or did not happen -- was enough.*

---

## Journal Reflection (Optional -- Never Required)

*Writing can sometimes help grief find words. But it does not have to. If you would like, consider one of these prompts. If not, simply rest.*

- What is present for you right now?
- If your grief could speak, what would it say?
- What do you want to remember about what you have lost?
- What kindness could you offer yourself today?

*You do not have to share this with anyone. It is yours.*

*If this prompt does not feel right today, you may skip it or write about something else that wants attention.*

## Evidence

> **What research suggests:** Mindfulness-based grief interventions show moderate evidence for reducing grief symptoms and supporting the natural grieving process. The approach of "being with" grief rather than avoiding or being overwhelmed by it aligns with the Dual Process Model of coping with bereavement (Stroebe & Schut, 1999). Continuing bonds theory (Klass et al., 1996) supports maintaining connection with what has been lost. Social support remains the strongest predictor of grief adjustment (Stroebe et al., 2005).

## When to Seek Professional Support

**Consider reaching out to a grief-specialized therapist if:**

- Grief is intensifying rather than shifting after 12+ months
- You are unable to function in daily life (work, self-care, relationships)
- You are having persistent thoughts of self-harm or suicide
- You are unable to accept the reality of the loss after extended time
- You have completely withdrawn from all relationships
- Substance use is increasing in response to grief
- You feel "stuck" in a way that frightens you

**This is not a sign of weakness. Grief can sometimes need more support than any practice can offer, and a skilled professional can provide that support.**

## Variations

### If this feels too intense
- Shorten the practice to just the Opening and Closing (6 minutes)
- Keep your eyes open throughout
- Hold a comfort object the entire time
- Do the practice with a trusted person sitting nearby
- Practice the Grounding section only -- that is a complete practice

### For grief over health or ability loss
- During the body awareness section, be gentle with areas of pain or change
- You might acknowledge: "My body has changed, and I am allowed to grieve that"
- Include gratitude for what your body can still do, without minimizing what has changed
- If mobility is limited, adapt the grounding to whatever position is comfortable

### For recent loss (first weeks)
- Shorten everything to 5-10 minutes
- More grounding, less engagement with grief content
- Simply being present is the entire practice
- You may need to stop at any moment -- that is expected and respected

### For anniversary or milestone grief
- Light a candle before beginning (if safe to do so)
- Place a photo or meaningful object nearby
- During the practice, you might silently say the name of who or what you have lost
- Allow the anniversary to be a threshold, not a deadline

### For anticipatory grief (loss that has not yet happened)
- Acknowledge that grief can begin before loss is complete
- You might say: "I am grieving what is changing" or "I am grieving what I can see coming"
- Be especially gentle -- anticipatory grief often carries guilt for grieving "too early"

---

## Building a Practice

**Frequency:** There is no required frequency. Practice when grief calls you to it. Some people find a daily practice helpful in acute grief. Some return to this practice on significant dates. Some use it once and carry the experience forward. All are right.

**Progression:**
- This practice can be repeated as many times as needed
- When sitting with grief feels possible (not comfortable -- possible), you might explore a Sitting With Grief practice
- There is no timeline for progression. Some people stay with Acknowledgment practices for months. That is exactly right
- Grief is not linear -- circling back is natural, not regression

---

## Background

### About This Practice

This practice is a modern adaptation drawing from mindfulness-based grief support, Buddhist impermanence traditions, and continuing bonds theory. It was designed to be the gentlest possible entry point for someone experiencing any kind of loss.

The practice asks nothing of the griever except presence. It does not require belief in any spiritual framework, adherence to any tradition, or any prior meditation experience. It is accessible to anyone who can sit or lie down and breathe.

### Why "Acknowledging" and Not "Accepting"

The word "acknowledging" was chosen deliberately. "Acceptance" can feel like it is asking too much, too soon. You do not need to accept your loss to benefit from this practice. You simply need to acknowledge that it is here.

Acknowledgment is the first step in the Grief Companionship Model:

```
Acknowledging (What has been lost?)     <-- You are here
  |
Sitting With (Can I be present with this grief?)
  |
Ritualizing (How do I mark and honor this loss?)
  |
Meaning-Making (How does this loss live in my life story?)
  |
Integration (How do I carry this forward with tenderness?)
```

Each step is taken when the griever is ready. There is no schedule.
