## Medical Safety Review

### Checklist

- [x] Medical disclaimer present and clear
- [x] No claims of curing any condition
- [x] Practice positioned as supportive, not therapeutic
- [x] Heat-related symptom awareness
- [x] Allergic reaction awareness
- [x] Stop instructions for physical symptoms
- [x] No dosage or treatment recommendations

---

## Physical Safety Review

### Checklist

- [x] Weather check required before practice
- [x] Sun exposure guidance (sunscreen, hat, timing)
- [x] Terrain awareness (appropriate footwear, known paths)
- [x] Wildlife and plant awareness (insects, ticks, poisonous plants)
- [x] Allergy awareness (pollen, plant contact)
- [x] Hydration reminder for practices over 20 minutes
- [x] Communication plan for extended practices
- [x] Phone carried for emergencies
- [x] Seasonal safety guidance for all four seasons

### Notes
- Winter guidance appropriately recommends shortening outdoor exposure
  and extending indoor practice.
- Summer guidance recommends morning or evening practice to avoid
  peak heat — good.
- The "do not taste unknown plants" warning is present in safety
  section and throughout.

## Cultural Attribution Review

### Checklist

- [x] *Shinrin-yoku* named with Japanese characters (森林浴)
- [x] Formalization date (1982) and agency credited
- [x] Shinto roots acknowledged as deeper tradition
- [x] Key researchers named (Li, Miyazaki)
- [x] Adaptation from traditional form acknowledged
- [x] No exoticizing language
- [x] No appropriation of closed Indigenous practices
- [x] Indigenous land connection mentioned educationally, not instructionally

### Notes
- The attribution paragraph is specific, respectful, and historically
  grounded. It acknowledges both the modern formalization and the
  deeper cultural roots without conflating them.
- The practice does not claim to be authentic Japanese *shinrin-yoku*
  but an adaptation — appropriate.

## Evidence Honesty Review

### Checklist

- [x] Evidence levels stated clearly (moderate-strong for cortisol, moderate for NK cells)
- [x] Specific studies cited with sample sizes (Park 2010 n=280, Li 2010)
- [x] Meta-analysis cited (Antonelli 2019)
- [x] Limitations noted (short-term, mostly Japanese samples, limited independent replication for NK cells)
- [x] "Suggests" language used throughout
- [x] Traditional use distinguished from clinical evidence
- [x] No overclaiming on health outcomes

### Notes
- The evidence box is well-structured with clear limitations.
- Phytoncides mentioned with appropriate hedging ("may support" and
  "requires further confirmation").
- The acknowledgment that most research is from Japan/South Korea is
  an important transparency point.

## Accessibility Review

### Physical
- [x] Seated option explicitly stated (bench throughout)
- [x] Wheelchair and mobility aid compatible on paved paths
- [x] No required walking (seated practice is complete)
- [x] Indoor alternative fully developed

### Cognitive
- [x] Clear sensory sequence (See, Hear, Smell, Touch, Integrate)
- [x] One instruction per step
- [x] Simple language throughout
- [x] No complex timing or technique requirements

### Sensory
- [x] Multi-sensory design (practice works if one sense is limited)

- [x] Tactile engagement prominent

### Psychological
- [x] Permission to stop at any phase
- [x] "No agenda" framing present

## Inclusion Review

- [x] "Even a single plant on a windowsill is nature too"
- [x] No judgment about practice setting

### Seasonal Inclusion
- [x] All four seasons addressed
- [x] Winter practice shortened outdoors, extended indoors

## Recommendations for Future Versions

1. Consider creating a companion audio guide with nature sound
   integration for the indoor alternative.
2. Develop a seasonal series (four versions, one per season) with
   specific observation prompts and themes.
3. Add a "regular practice" section for users who want to visit the
   same spot weekly and track changes over time.
4. Consider a paired/group version of the practice for social
   connection alongside nature connection.
5. Develop accessibility guidance for users with visual impairments
   (the practice is already multi-sensory, but explicit guidance
   would strengthen inclusion).
