## Forest Bathing (Shinrin-yoku)

### Evidence Level: Moderate-Strong (60+ studies)

The majority of forest bathing research originates from Japan and South
Korea, with a growing number of studies from Europe, North America, and
China.

### Key Studies

**Li, Q. et al. (2007).** "Forest bathing enhances human natural
killer activity and expression of anti-cancer proteins." *International
Journal of Immunopathology and Pharmacology*, 20(2 Suppl 2), 3-8.
- Controlled field experiment, n=12 (male office workers)
- 3-day/2-night forest trip vs. urban control
- NK cell activity significantly increased after forest bathing
- NK cell activity remained elevated for 30 days after the trip
- Proposed mechanism: phytoncides (volatile organic compounds from trees)
- Limitation: very small sample, male only, no randomization

**Li, Q. (2010).** "Effect of forest bathing trips on human immune
function." *Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine*, 15(1), 9-17.
- Review of multiple studies on forest bathing and immune function
- Consistent finding: forest environments increase NK cell activity
  and intracellular anti-cancer proteins
- Phytoncides identified as potential mechanism
- Limitation: most studies small (n<20), same research group

**Park, B.J. et al. (2010).** "The physiological effects of
Shinrin-yoku (taking in the forest atmosphere or forest bathing):
evidence from field experiments in 24 forests across Japan."
*Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine*, 15(1), 18-26.

  - Blood pressure
  - Sympathetic nervous system activity
- Forest environments significantly increased:
  - Parasympathetic nervous system activity
  - Heart rate variability
- Robust design: 24 different forests, large sample for field research
- Limitation: single-day measurements, no long-term follow-up

**Antonelli, M. et al. (2019).** "Effects of forest bathing
(shinrin-yoku) on levels of cortisol as a stress biomarker: a
systematic review and meta-analysis." *International Journal of
Biometeorology*, 63(8), 1117-1134.
- Meta-analysis of cortisol studies in forest environments
- Consistent finding: forest bathing reduces salivary cortisol
- Pooled effect size: significant and clinically meaningful
- Limitation: heterogeneity in study designs, publication bias possible

**Wen, Y. et al. (2019).** "Medical empirical research on forest
bathing: a systematic review." *Environmental Health and Preventive
Medicine*, 24(1), 70.
- Systematic review of 28 studies
- Consistent evidence for mood improvement and stress reduction
- Moderate evidence for cardiovascular benefits
- Inconsistent evidence for immune function (study quality varies)
- Called for more rigorous study designs with larger samples

## Green Space and Mental Health

### Evidence Level: Strong (large epidemiological studies)

**Bratman, G.N. et al. (2019).** "Nature and mental health: An
ecosystem service perspective." *Science Advances*, 5(7), eaax0903.
- Major review in *Science Advances*
- Synthesized evidence across multiple disciplines
- Found consistent associations between nature exposure and:
  - Reduced depression and anxiety
  - Improved mood and self-esteem
  - Enhanced cognitive function (attention, memory)
  - Reduced rumination (repetitive negative thinking)
- Proposed ecosystem service framework for valuing nature-health
  relationship
- Acknowledged: most evidence correlational; mechanisms debated

**White, M.P. et al. (2019).** "Spending at least 120 minutes a week
in nature is associated with good health and wellbeing." *Scientific
Reports*, 9, 7730.
- Large cross-sectional study, n=19,806 (England)
- 120 minutes per week in nature associated with significantly higher
  self-reported health and wellbeing
- Threshold effect: benefits appeared at 120 min/week; little
  additional benefit beyond 200-300 min/week
- No significant benefit below 120 min/week in this study
- Limitation: cross-sectional (no causation), self-report

**Bratman, G.N. et al. (2015).** "Nature experience reduces rumination
and subgenual prefrontal cortex activation." *PNAS*, 112(28), 8567-8572.
- Experimental study, n=38
- 90-minute walk in nature vs. urban environment
- Nature walk reduced self-reported rumination
- Nature walk reduced neural activity in subgenual prefrontal cortex
  (associated with repetitive negative thinking)
- Limitation: small sample, single session

## Earthing/Grounding

### Evidence Level: Preliminary

**Oschman, J.L. et al. (2015).** "The effects of grounding (earthing)
on inflammation, the immune response, wound healing, and prevention
and treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases."
*Journal of Inflammation Research*, 8, 83-96.
- Review of earthing research
- Proposed mechanism: electron transfer from earth to body, reducing
  oxidative stress and inflammation
- Studies cited show effects on cortisol, sleep, pain, blood viscosity
- Limitation: most studies small, some industry-funded, lack of
  independent replication, no large RCTs

**Chevalier, G. et al. (2012).** "Earthing: health implications of
reconnecting the human body to the Earth's surface electrons."
*Journal of Environmental and Public Health*, 2012, 291541.
- Review article summarizing earthing research
- Effects reported on sleep, pain, cortisol, stress
- Limitation: authors hold patents related to grounding products;
  potential conflict of interest; small studies

**Honest Assessment:**
Earthing research shows intriguing preliminary results, but the evidence
base has significant limitations:
- Small sample sizes (most studies n<30)
- Limited independent replication
- Potential conflicts of interest (industry involvement)
- No large, independent RCTs published to date
- Mechanisms plausible but not confirmed

We present earthing as a practice with preliminary research interest,
not as an evidence-based intervention.

## Nature Sounds and Stress

### Evidence Level: Moderate

**Buxton, R.T. et al. (2021).** "A synthesis of health benefits of
natural sounds and their distribution in national parks." *PNAS*,
118(14), e2013097118.
- Meta-analysis of 36 studies on natural sounds and health
- Natural sounds (birdsong, water, wind) significantly reduced:
  - Pain perception
  - Stress (physiological and self-report)
  - Annoyance
- Natural sounds significantly improved:
  - Mood
  - Cognitive performance
  - Health outcomes (varied measures)
- Water sounds had the most consistent health benefits
- Bird sounds had the largest effect on stress reduction
- Limitation: heterogeneous study designs, varied sound stimuli

**Ratcliffe, E. et al. (2013).** "Bird sounds and their contributions
to perceived attention restoration and stress recovery." *Journal of
Environmental Psychology*, 36, 221-228.
- Experimental study examining specific bird sounds
- Birdsong associated with perceived attention restoration
- Different bird species had different effects
- Culturally familiar bird sounds rated as more restorative
- Limitation: laboratory setting (not field-based)

## Attention Restoration Theory (Supporting Framework)

### Evidence Level: Moderate-Strong (theoretical framework with empirical support)

**Kaplan, S. (1995).** "The restorative benefits of nature: Toward an
integrative framework." *Journal of Environmental Psychology*, 15(3),
169-182.
- Theoretical paper proposing that natural environments restore
  directed attention through "soft fascination"
- Extensively cited (5000+ citations)
- Supported by subsequent experimental and correlational studies
- Not all predictions confirmed; some debate about mechanisms

**Stevenson, M.P. et al. (2018).** "Attention Restoration Theory and
systematic review of attention restoration." *Journal of Toxicology
and Environmental Health, Part B*, 21(4), 227-268.

## Gaps in Evidence

1. **Long-term outcomes:** Most forest bathing studies measure acute
   effects. Few track long-term health outcomes from regular practice.
2. **Dose-response:** The optimal frequency, duration, and type of
   nature exposure is not well-established (White 2019 suggests 120
   min/week as threshold).
3. **Urban nature:** Most studies compare forest to city. Less research
   on the value of urban green spaces specifically.
4. **Clinical populations:** Limited research on nature-based practices
   for specific clinical conditions.
5. **Cultural generalizability:** Most research from Japan, South Korea,
   and Northern Europe. Less data from other regions.
6. **Mechanisms:** Proposed mechanisms (phytoncides, attention
   restoration, stress recovery) are plausible but not fully confirmed.
