# What Does Healing Mean to You?: A Contemplative Inquiry Practice

**Inquiry type:** Structured Reflection
**Tradition:** Synthesized — Socratic questioning, Ignatian reflection, ACT-informed
**Duration:** 20 minutes
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Focus:** Investigating your personal relationship to the concept of healing
**Best for:** Anyone beginning a healing journey, anyone questioning what healing means, anyone who feels stuck in assumptions about recovery

---

## Overview

This practice invites you to sit with a single question — "What does healing mean to you?" — with curiosity and patience. Rather than seeking a quick answer, you'll hold the question gently in awareness, noticing what arises: thoughts, feelings, body sensations, memories, and silence.

This is not a test. There are no right answers. The practice is the questioning itself.

> **Evidence note:** Research on metacognitive awareness (Wells, 2009) and cognitive defusion (Hayes et al., 1999) supports the therapeutic value of observing one's relationship to thoughts and beliefs. Structured reflective practices have been associated with improved self-awareness and emotional regulation in healthcare settings (Beckman et al., 2012, PMID: 22534597). This practice is offered as contemplative exploration, not as a validated therapeutic intervention.

## Before You Begin

### You'll Need
- 20 minutes of uninterrupted time
- A quiet, comfortable space
- Seated position (chair, cushion, or floor)
- Optional: journal and pen for reflection afterwards
- A willingness to sit with a question without needing an answer

### Important Safety Information

**This practice involves reflecting on your relationship to healing, health, and recovery.** For most people, this is gentle and meaningful work. However, if you are in acute distress, it may not be appropriate right now.

- **Do not practice** if you are currently experiencing severe depression without therapeutic support, active psychosis, dissociative episodes, or suicidal thoughts. Please seek support from a mental health professional
- **Always have grounding available** (see Grounding section below)
- **Stop at any time** if you feel overwhelmed, panicked, or disconnected from yourself
- These practices complement but do not replace mental health treatment

*You can stop at any time. Stopping is always a valid choice.*

### Grounding Anchor (Learn This First)

**Quick Grounding — memorize before starting:**
1. Open your eyes. Look at something specific and ordinary
2. Feel your feet on the floor, your body in the chair
3. Breathe: in for 4 counts through nose, out for 6 through mouth
4. Name 3 things you can see, 2 you can touch, 1 you can hear
5. Say your name, today's date, where you are

*This is your anchor. Use it whenever you need to return to ordinary awareness.*

## Tradition Attribution

> This inquiry practice draws on the spirit of Socratic questioning (5th century BCE) — the systematic examination of beliefs through careful questioning — and the Ignatian Examen (16th century) — structured daily reflection for integration and discernment. It is also informed by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy's approach to examining one's relationship to thoughts (Hayes et al., 1999). We have adapted these principles into a self-guided contemplative exploration for people navigating healing journeys. We honor the traditions that have developed and preserved these methods of reflective investigation.

## The Practice

### Phase 1: Settling and Grounding (5 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Arrive fully in your body and your present environment before beginning the inquiry.

**How to do it:**
1. Sit comfortably. Feet flat on the floor. Hands resting in your lap or on your knees
2. Close your eyes partially or fully — whatever feels safe and comfortable
3. Take 3 slow, natural breaths. Don't try to control them — just notice the air coming in and going out
4. Feel the weight of your body in the chair or on the cushion. The solidity of the floor beneath your feet. You are here, supported
5. Notice your shoulders. If there's tension, let them soften — just a little. Not forcing anything
6. Notice the sounds around you. The temperature of the air. The quality of light in the room, even behind closed eyes
7. Run the grounding anchor once: name 3 things you can see (open eyes briefly), 2 you can touch (feel the chair, your clothing), 1 you can hear. Quietly say your name
8. Set a gentle intention: "I'm going to sit with a question about healing. I don't need to find an answer. I just need to be present with the question"
9. Take 2 more slow breaths. You are grounded. You are ready

*Duration: 5 minutes. Take your time with this phase — there is no rush.*

---

### Phase 2: Receiving the Question (2 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Receive the inquiry question and let it settle into your awareness.

**The question:**

> *What does healing mean to you?*

**How to do it:**
1. Read the question above, or say it quietly to yourself: "What does healing mean to me?"
2. Let the words land. Don't immediately answer
3. Read or say it again, more slowly: "What... does healing... mean... to me?"
4. Notice what happens when you hear the question. Not what you *think* about it — what happens. Does something shift in your body? Does your mind start offering answers? Does nothing happen at all?
5. You don't need to do anything with this question yet. Just receive it, the way you might receive a gift you haven't opened

**What you might notice:**
- An immediate answer may jump forward: "Getting better," "Being pain-free," "Going back to normal." That's your first response — notice it, then set it gently aside. There may be more underneath
- The question may feel obvious, or confusing, or strangely moving. Any response is informative
- Your body may respond — a tightening, a softening, a sensation you can't name. That is also part of the inquiry

*Duration: 2 minutes*

---

### Phase 3: Sitting With the Question (5 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Hold the question in your awareness without trying to answer it. Let the inquiry do its own work.

**How to do it:**
1. Let the question rest in your awareness. "What does healing mean to me?" You're not solving it. You're sitting with it — like sitting beside a fire, watching it
2. When answers arise (and they will), notice them gently. You might think: "Healing means getting back to my old self." Acknowledge that: "That's one answer." Then return to the question. Is there more?
3. Notice what happens in your body as you sit with this question. Where do you feel it? Your chest? Your belly? Your throat? Your hands?
4. Notice what emotions surface. Longing? Grief? Hope? Frustration? Calm? Nothing particular? All are welcome here
5. If the mind wanders — to plans, worries, the grocery list — that's perfectly normal. Gently bring it back to the question. This gentle returning IS the practice
6. Let the question turn itself over. You might naturally find yourself asking related questions: "What would it feel like to be healed?" or "Am I already healing?" or "What if healing isn't what I thought it was?" Follow what arises, gently

**What you might notice:**
- Layers of answers — the quick, surface answers first ("feeling better"), then perhaps deeper ones ("feeling whole," "feeling like myself," "accepting what is")
- Silence — periods where no answer comes. This silence is not failure. Stay with it. The silence is where the question does its deepest work
- Surprise — an answer you didn't expect, or an emotion that seems unrelated
- Contradiction — you may hold two opposite ideas about healing at the same time. That is honest, and it is allowed
- Nothing in particular — if nothing seems to happen, that is genuinely fine. The practice works below the surface

*If at any point you feel overwhelmed or destabilized, use the grounding anchor: open your eyes, feet on floor, breathe, name what you see, say your name. You can return to the inquiry another day.*

*Duration: 5 minutes*

---

### Phase 4: Noticing What Has Arisen (3 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Gently release the question and observe what the inquiry has surfaced.

**How to do it:**
1. Let the question go. You don't need to hold it anymore. It has done its work for today
2. What remains? What is present in your awareness right now? Not what you think *should* be present — what actually is
3. Is there a thought or phrase that has stayed with you from the inquiry? Notice it without grabbing onto it
4. Check in with your body. Has anything shifted — even subtly? More tense? More relaxed? More open? The same?
5. Check in with your emotional tone. Has anything changed from how you felt before the practice?
6. You don't need to evaluate or make sense of anything. Just notice what is present

**What you might notice:**
- A new perspective — even slight — on what healing means to you
- A feeling of tenderness or openness
- A realization that you held an assumption you didn't know you held
- Tiredness — inquiry uses real cognitive and emotional energy
- Peace — or at least, a moment of quiet
- Nothing discernible — that is also a valid outcome. Some seeds grow underground

*Duration: 3 minutes*

---

### Phase 5: Grounding and Return (5 minutes)

**What you'll do:**
Return completely to ordinary, grounded, present-moment awareness.

**How to do it:**
1. Let the entire inquiry dissolve. You can return to these reflections later. Right now, you are returning to the present
2. Place both feet flat on the floor. Press gently. Feel the ground beneath you — solid, reliable, here
3. Put one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Feel yourself breathing. In and out. Your body, doing what it does
4. Open your eyes fully. Look around the room deliberately. Really see the space you are in
5. Name 5 things you can see — say them quietly or aloud: "Chair. Window. Book. Cup. Wall"
6. Touch something near you. Feel its texture. Its temperature. Its weight
7. Say your name, today's date, and where you are: "I am [name]. It is [date]. I am sitting in [place]"
8. Wiggle your fingers and toes. Roll your shoulders. Stretch your arms gently
9. If water is available, take a sip. The ordinariness of drinking water is itself a grounding practice
10. Wait until you feel fully present — fully "you," fully "here" — before standing

**What you might notice:**
- A sense of freshness — perception may feel slightly more vivid after inquiry. This is normal and usually pleasant
- Tiredness — contemplative inquiry takes real energy. Be gentle with yourself
- Emotional tenderness — the question may have touched something that's still settling
- Lightness — sometimes examining a heavy question makes it lighter
- Nothing dramatic — also completely normal

*Take 2-3 minutes after grounding before moving on with your day. Do something simple: stretch, wash your hands, take a short walk. Let the practice integrate on its own.*

## Reflection (Optional)

If you'd like to record your experience, you might consider these prompts. You can journal now, later today, or not at all — there's no requirement.

- When I sat with "What does healing mean to you?", the first answer that came was...
- But underneath that, I also noticed...
- Something that surprised me was...
- I noticed in my body that...
- If I had to describe my sense of "healing" in one image or metaphor, it might be...
- A question I'd like to sit with next time is...

*Journaling is not required. Some people process inquiry through writing; others through walking, through conversation, through art, or through simply living with what arose. Find what works for you.*

## What Research Suggests

**Claim:** Examining one's beliefs and assumptions about illness and healing can improve psychological flexibility and wellbeing.

**Evidence level:** Moderate (for ACT/defusion approaches); Preliminary (for self-guided reflective inquiry)

**Summary:** Acceptance and Commitment Therapy research demonstrates that changing one's *relationship* to thoughts — observing them as mental events rather than facts — is associated with reduced psychological distress and improved quality of life across multiple conditions, including chronic pain, anxiety, and depression.

**Key study:** A-Tjak JG et al. (2015). Meta-analysis of 39 RCTs (N=4,781). ACT superior to control conditions with moderate effect sizes (Hedges' g = 0.57). PMID: 25547522

**Limitations:** Most evidence is for therapist-delivered ACT, not self-guided inquiry. The specific practice in this protocol has not been independently studied. The contemplative inquiry framework draws on evidence-based principles but is itself offered as contemplative exploration.

**Standard phrase:** "Studies suggest that observing one's relationship to thoughts and beliefs about healing may support psychological flexibility, though direct research on self-guided contemplative inquiry practices is limited."

## When to Seek a Teacher

This practice is designed for self-guided use. However, you might benefit from working with a trained guide if:

- The question "What does healing mean to you?" opens into deeper questions about identity, purpose, or existence that feel too large to hold alone
- You find yourself wanting to explore traditional inquiry practices (Zen koan, Advaita self-inquiry, Ignatian discernment) in their proper context
- You are processing significant grief, trauma, or life transition and would benefit from companionship in the inquiry
- The practice consistently surfaces strong emotions that you don't know how to integrate

**Where to look:**
- Psychotherapists trained in ACT or existential therapy
- Interfaith spiritual directors
- Philosophical counseling practitioners (APPA, NPCA directories)
- Meditation teachers in established contemplative traditions

---

## Contraindications

**Do not practice this inquiry if you are currently experiencing:**
- Active psychosis or psychotic features
- Severe depression without therapeutic support
- Active dissociative disorders
- Severe depersonalization/derealization
- Active suicidal ideation
- Acute trauma response

**Use with caution and shorter sessions if you have:**
- History of dissociative experiences
- Anxiety disorders (shorten the inquiry phase; emphasize grounding)
- Ongoing grief process (this practice may be helpful but may also surface strong emotion — be gentle)

*If you have any mental health conditions, consult your provider before beginning practices that involve deep self-reflection.*

---

## Variations

### If this feels too intense
- Shorten the inquiry phase (Phase 3) to 2-3 minutes
- Keep your eyes open throughout
- Focus primarily on the settling and grounding phases
- Ask a simpler version: "What helps me feel well?" instead of the broader healing question
- Practice with a trusted friend nearby

### If nothing seems to happen
- This is normal and valuable — some inquiries work underground
- Try the same question tomorrow — you may notice something different
- Write your responses instead of sitting silently
- "Nothing happened" is itself worth noticing: what does it mean that this question doesn't stir anything right now?

### If you want to go deeper
- Extend Phase 3 (sitting with the question) to 8-10 minutes
- Return to this same question across multiple sessions — it will reveal different layers
- Try a more specific version: "What does healing mean for [this specific condition/situation]?"
- After several sessions, try: "What if healing isn't what I think it is?"

### For different times of day
- **Morning:** "What does healing look like today?" — shorter, more practical
- **Midday:** Brief 5-minute version — just the question and 2 minutes of sitting
- **Evening:** Full practice, with journaling — good for processing the day

---

## Building a Practice

**Frequency:** 2-3 times per week. This question benefits from spacing — let each session settle before returning to it.

**Duration:** Start with this 20-minute format. As the settling and grounding become familiar, you'll naturally find your rhythm.

**Progression:**
- Sessions 1-3: Sit with "What does healing mean to you?" — notice what arises
- Sessions 4-6: Notice if the question has changed for you. Has "healing" shifted in meaning?
- Sessions 7+: If you feel stable, try a deeper question: "Who is the one seeking healing?" or "What would it feel like to be already whole?"
- Ongoing: The question may change, deepen, or dissolve. All of these are valid trajectories

*There is no pressure to advance. If "What does healing mean to you?" remains a rich and rewarding inquiry for months, that is a sign of genuine contemplative depth, not of being stuck.*

## Background

### About This Practice

This inquiry draws on a principle shared across contemplative traditions: that sitting with a meaningful question — without rushing to an answer — can reveal assumptions, open perspective, and connect us more honestly with our experience.

The specific question, "What does healing mean to you?", is designed to investigate one of the most fundamental assumptions people carry through a healing journey: that they know what healing is. Many people discover, through this inquiry, that their concept of healing has been borrowed — from doctors, family, culture, media — rather than genuinely examined. The practice creates space for a more personal, honest relationship with what healing means.

### Cross-Tradition Parallels

- **Socratic Method** (5th century BCE) — Examining beliefs through questioning to reveal what we actually know vs. what we assume
- **Ignatian Examen** (16th century) — Structured reflection for discernment and self-knowledge
- **ACT Cognitive Defusion** (Hayes, 1999) — Observing thoughts as events rather than facts, creating space between belief and identity
- **Zen** (Rinzai, 12th century) — The spirit of "beginner's mind" (*shoshin*) — approaching familiar questions as if for the first time

*We honor each tradition's distinct context. This practice is a modern adaptation drawing on shared principles of reflective inquiry.*

---

*This practice complements but does not replace medical or psychological care. If you have any mental health conditions, consult your provider before beginning practices that involve deep self-reflection about health and healing.*
