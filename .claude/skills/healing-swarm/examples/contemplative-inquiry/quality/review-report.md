## Detailed Review

### 1. Safety Framing

**Medical disclaimer:** Present in "Important Safety Information" section before practice begins, and repeated at end of document.

**Mental health screening:** Specific screening note addresses severe depression, active psychosis, dissociative disorders, and suicidal ideation. Practice is correctly identified as inappropriate for these populations.

**Contraindications:** Full list present in dedicated section:
- Active psychosis or psychotic features
- Severe depression without therapeutic support
- Active dissociative disorders
- Severe depersonalization/derealization
- Active suicidal ideation
- Acute trauma response
- Caution-level conditions also listed

**Exit ramps:** Present at every practice phase:
- Phase 1 (Settling): Grounding anchor taught as prerequisite
- Phase 3 (Sitting): "If at any point you feel overwhelmed or destabilized, use the grounding anchor"
- General: "You can stop at any time. Stopping is always a valid choice"

**Permission to stop:** Explicitly stated multiple times throughout.

**Assessment:** Safety framing is comprehensive and exceeds minimum requirements for a beginner-level structured reflection practice.

### 2. Evidence Honesty

**Evidence note:** Present in Overview section. Correctly identifies:
- Metacognitive therapy (Wells, 2009)
- ACT/cognitive defusion (Hayes et al., 1999)
- Healthcare reflective practice (Beckman et al., 2012, PMID: 22534597)
- Framing as "contemplative exploration, not validated therapeutic intervention"

**Evidence box ("What Research Suggests"):** Present with:
- Specific claim identified
- Evidence level stated (Moderate for ACT; Preliminary for self-guided)
- Key study cited with PMID (A-Tjak et al., 2015, PMID: 25547522)
- Sample size and effect size included (N=4,781, Hedges' g = 0.57)
- Limitations explicitly noted: "Most evidence is for therapist-delivered ACT, not self-guided inquiry"
- Appropriate evidence language: "Studies suggest..."

**No overclaims identified.** The practice does not promise insight, healing, or transformation. Language consistently uses "may," "might," "some people find."

**Assessment:** Evidence honesty is thorough. Claims match cited evidence. Limitations are transparently stated.

### 3. Tradition Attribution

**Traditions identified:**
- Socratic questioning: "5th century BCE" — correct dating
- Ignatian Examen: "16th century" — correct dating
- ACT: "Hayes et al., 1999" — correct attribution
- Zen (beginner's mind reference): "Rinzai, 12th century" — correct dating

**Attribution statement:** Present in "Tradition Attribution" section. Clearly states this is an adaptation, not authentic practice from any single tradition. Expresses gratitude to tradition holders.

**No appropriation concerns:** The practice is correctly framed as a modern synthesis, not as transmission of any specific tradition. Koan practice is referenced (in Background) as a parallel, not claimed as what this practice is.

**Assessment:** Tradition attribution meets all requirements. Sources are specific, dates are accurate, and the relationship between the practice and its source traditions is honestly described.

### 4. Grounding Adequacy

**Pre-practice grounding:**
- Grounding anchor taught before practice begins (memorization requested)
- Phase 1 settling is 5 minutes (meets contemplative-protocol minimum)
- Body-based grounding: feet on floor, breath, sensory awareness
- Grounding anchor run once during settling phase
- Intention set: inquiry framing, not performance framing

**Mid-practice exit ramp:**
- Quick Grounding available at every phase
- Explicit instruction: "If at any point you feel overwhelmed... use the grounding anchor"
- Permission to stop and return another day

**Post-practice grounding:**
- Phase 5 is 5 minutes (meets contemplative-protocol minimum)
- 10-step grounding process: feet, hands, breathing, eyes, naming, touch, identity statement, physical movement, water, stability check
- "Wait until you feel fully present... before standing"
- Post-practice physical activity suggested

**Assessment:** Grounding is thorough and exceeds minimum requirements. The 5-5 structure (5 minutes settling, 5 minutes return) is appropriate for beginner-level inquiry. Exit ramps are clearly marked.

### 6. Voice and Tone

**Tone assessment:** Medium-deep on voice-guide spectrum — appropriate for a guided contemplative practice.

**Language patterns:**
- Invitational: "You might notice..." / "Some people find..." — correctly used throughout
- Concrete: "Feel your feet on the floor" / "Name 5 things you see" — grounded language throughout
- No mystification: No references to ego death, transcendence, cosmic awareness, or guaranteed states
- Compassionate without being saccharine: "Be gentle with yourself" rather than "Sending love!"
- Empowering: User positioned as active agent throughout

**Words checked against voice-guide avoid list:**
- "Cure" — not used
- "Guarantee" — not used
- "Should" — not used prescriptively
- "Always/Never" — not used as absolutes
- "Easy" — not used
- "Just" — not used dismissively
- "Ancient secrets" — not used
- "Mystical powers" — not used

**Assessment:** Voice and tone are fully aligned with voice-guide.md standards.

### 7. Ethics Guardrails Compliance

**Medical safety:**
- No diagnosis or treatment claims
- "Complement, not replace" language present
- Healthcare provider consultation recommended
- No claims about curing conditions

**Psychological safety:**
- No shame language for "not healing"
- No karma/punishment framing
- No promises of emotional outcomes
- Self-compassion messaging throughout
- Mental health crisis resources direction (to providers, not specific numbers — could be enhanced)

**Cultural integrity:**
- No closed/initiatory practices used
- Sources documented with dates
- No exoticizing language
- Traditions respected as living systems

**Assessment:** Ethics guardrails fully respected. One minor suggestion: consider adding 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline number in the contraindications section for users who may need immediate support.

## Minor Recommendations (Non-Blocking)

1. **Crisis resource number:** Consider adding "If you are in crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988)" in the contraindications section.

2. **Audio adaptation note:** The practice is designed for reading. A brief note about adapting it for audio recording (e.g., "This practice can also be recorded as a guided audio. Add 3-5 seconds of silence between instructions") would support content production.

3. **Group adaptation:** A brief note about using this inquiry in group settings (with consent framework from ethics-guardrails) could extend the practice's reach.

These are suggestions for future enhancement, not requirements for approval.
