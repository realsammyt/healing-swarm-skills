# Language Awareness Example

> A complete example demonstrating the language awareness skill lifecycle
> for cognitive deautomatization practices.

## What This Example Shows

This example walks through creating a beginner language awareness practice. It demonstrates:

1. **Research** - Gathering deautomatization evidence and tradition context
2. **Protocol Design** - Creating a safe observation practice with grounding
3. **Safety Review** - Psychological safety and grounding adequacy checks
4. **Final Output** - Ready-to-use practice protocol

---

## The Skill We're Building

**Name:** `label-delay-practice`
**Purpose:** A 5-minute beginner practice for observing automatic naming
**Level:** Observation (Level 1)
**Traditions:** Zen (shikantaza), Phenomenology (epoché), Vipassana (noting)
**Evidence:** Moderate (Deikman 1966, semantic satiation research)

## Step 1: Research

### Deautomatization Evidence

From `research/deautomatization-evidence.md`:

```markdown
# Language Awareness Research: Deautomatization Evidence

## Evidence Level: Moderate (for underlying principles)

### Foundational Research

**Deikman (1966) - "Deautomatization and the Mystic Experience"**
- Coined the term "deautomatization"
- Described the process of undoing automatic perceptual patterns
- Proposed as mechanism underlying contemplative experiences
- Theoretical paper with observational support

**Jakobovits & Lambert (1962) - Semantic Satiation**
- Repeated exposure to a word reduces perceived meaning
- Well-replicated finding across multiple studies
- Demonstrates that meaning is actively constructed, not inherent
- Provides empirical grounding for deautomatization concept

**Lutz et al. (2004) - Meditation and Gamma Synchrony**
- Long-term meditators show enhanced gamma synchrony
- Suggests altered perceptual processing with practice
- Supports claim that attention practices change perception
- Well-cited but requires replication

### Key Insight

Language automatically categorizes experience before we are
aware of it. The naming process is so fast that we typically
perceive the label, not the raw sensation. Deautomatization
practices slow this process enough to notice the gap between
sensation and label.

### Limitations

- Direct research on label delay exercises is limited
- Most evidence is from broader mindfulness research
- Mechanism pathways not fully established
- Individual variation is large
```

### Tradition Parallels

From `research/tradition-parallels.md`:

```markdown
# Language Awareness Research: Tradition Parallels

## Cross-Tradition Context

### Zen Buddhism - Shikantaza ("Just Sitting")
Non-conceptual awareness without object. The practitioner sits
without naming, categorizing, or following thoughts. This is
the contemplative tradition most closely aligned with label
delay practice.

### Phenomenology - Husserl's Epoché
"Bracketing" assumptions to see "the things themselves."
The phenomenological reduction asks: what remains when we
set aside our interpretive frameworks?

### Dzogchen - Rigpa
Recognition of awareness prior to conceptual overlay.
The "natural state" before labeling.

### Vipassana - Noting Practice
Observing mental processes without adding interpretation.
"Bare attention" to experience as it arises.

### Chase Hughes - Tongue: A Cognitive Hazard (2024)
Modern behavioral framing of language as automatic perception
filter. Provides accessible exercises for noticing the
"machinery" of language.

**Attribution:** These practices draw on shared principles
across traditions. We honor each tradition's distinct context
and do not conflate them.

## Step 2: Protocol Design

From `content/label-delay-practice.md`:

```markdown
# Label Delay Practice: Language Awareness Protocol

**Type:** Cognitive Deautomatization Practice
**Level:** Observation (Level 1)
**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Tradition:** Draws on Zen, Phenomenology, Vipassana principles
**Evidence Level:** Moderate

## Before You Begin

### Important Safety Information

These practices temporarily change how you experience thoughts
and self-perception. This is expected and usually resolves within
minutes after practice.

**Do not practice** if you have:
- Active psychosis or psychotic features
- Active dissociative disorders
- Severe depersonalization/derealization
- Acute mental health crisis

**You can stop at any time. Stopping is always a valid choice.**

### Learn the Grounding Anchor First

**Pocket Exit** (memorize before starting):
1. Tongue tip to roof of mouth, behind front teeth
2. Left thumb to sternum center, press lightly
3. Breathe: in for 4 heartbeats through nose, out for 6
4. Look at the nearest object — name it deliberately
5. Say one useful number aloud

---

## The Practice

### Phase 1: Settling (1 minute)

Sit comfortably. Run the Pocket Exit once as preparation.

Set your intention: "I'm going to observe how my mind names things."

Take 3 natural breaths.

### Phase 2: Label Delay (3 minutes)

Look at an object near you — anything ordinary.

**Instead of naming it, notice:**
- Its shape
- Its color
- Its texture (imagine touching it)
- How light falls on it
- Its weight (imagine holding it)

When the name arrives — and it will — notice that moment.
The gap between seeing and naming is the practice.

**Do this with 5 different objects,** spending about 30 seconds
on each.

**If the names come instantly:** That's normal. Just notice HOW
FAST the naming is. That noticing IS the practice.

**If this feels uncomfortable:** Use the Pocket Exit and stop.
You can try again another day.

### Phase 3: Return (1 minute)

Run the Pocket Exit:
1. Tongue to roof of mouth
2. Thumb to sternum
3. Breathe in for 4, out for 6
4. Look around — deliberately name 5 things you see
5. Say today's date aloud

Wait until naming feels completely normal before standing up.

---

## What You Might Notice

- Names arrive faster than you expected
- Brief moments of "seeing" before the label lands
- Objects look slightly different without their names
- Nothing in particular (this is valid and common)
- The practice feels simple (it is — simplicity is the point)

---

## Perception Journal

After practice, note:
- **Catches:** Moments you noticed language doing something automatic
- **Gaps:** Moments of wordless perception, however brief
- **Survivors:** Words or phrases that resisted delay

---

## Background

The term "deautomatization" was coined by Arthur Deikman (1966)
to describe undoing automatic perceptual patterns through
sustained attention. Jakobovits & Lambert (1962) demonstrated
that repeated word exposure reduces perceived meaning (semantic
satiation), showing that meaning is actively constructed.

This practice adapts principles shared across contemplative
traditions: Zen shikantaza (non-conceptual awareness), Husserl's
phenomenological epoché (bracketing assumptions), and vipassana
bare attention (observing without interpreting).

## Disclaimer

This practice is for contemplative exploration, not validated
therapeutic intervention. It complements but does not replace
mental health care. If you have any mental health conditions,
consult your provider before beginning.

## Try It Yourself

```bash
# Generate a beginner practice
/language-awareness "first practice" --level observation

# Generate an interruption-level practice
/language-awareness "create gaps in naming" --level interruption

# Generate a group exercise
