## The Practice

### Settling In (30 seconds)

Let your eyes close gently, or soften your gaze downward.

Take a moment to arrive. Notice where your body meets what's supporting it.

There's nothing to do right now except be here.

### Natural Breath (1 minute)

Begin by simply noticing your natural breath.

You don't need to change anything. Just observe:
- Where do you feel the breath?
- Is it shallow or deep?
- Fast or slow?

Whatever you notice is fine. You're just getting acquainted.

### Extending the Exhale (2.5 minutes)

Now, gently begin to slow your breath.

**Inhale** through your nose for a count of 4.
*One... two... three... four...*

**Hold** gently for a count of 7.
*One... two... three... four... five... six... seven...*

**Exhale** slowly through your mouth for a count of 8.
*One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight...*

Repeat this cycle 3-4 times.

If the counts feel too long, shorten them proportionally (3-5-6 or 2-3-4). The ratio matters more than the numbers.

### Returning (1 minute)

Let go of the counting.

Allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm.

Notice how you feel now. You might notice:
- A sense of calm
- Heaviness in your limbs
- Slower thoughts
- Or something else entirely

Whatever you experience is valid.

When you're ready, let your eyes open gently. Take a moment before returning to your day.

## If You Feel Lightheaded

Stop the counted breathing and breathe normally.

This is a sign to shorten your counts next time, or to practice without the hold.

Lightheadedness is not dangerous, but it means you've pushed past what's helpful.

## Background

This practice adapts the extended exhale principle from yogic pranayama, documented in classical texts like the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (c. 400 CE). The 4-7-8 ratio was popularized by Dr. Andrew Weil for Western audiences.

Research suggests that slow breathing with extended exhale activates the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation. Studies show improvements in heart rate variability and reductions in state anxiety, though most research uses small samples.
