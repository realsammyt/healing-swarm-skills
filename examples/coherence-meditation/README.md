## The Skill

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | `morning-coherence` |
| **Purpose** | 20-minute beginner coherence meditation |
| **Tradition** | Grinberg's self-allusive meditation (UNAM, 1970s-1994) |
| **Evidence** | Preliminary (small sample EEG studies) |

## Step 1: Research

### EEG Coherence Evidence

```
Evidence Level: Preliminary

Key Research:
- Grinberg-Zylberbaum conducted EEG studies at UNAM (1970s-1994)
- Reported enhanced interhemispheric coherence during meditation
  (alpha 8-12 Hz and theta 4-8 Hz synchronization)
- Small sample sizes with limited independent replication

Broader Context:
- Lutz et al. (2004): Long-term meditators show gamma synchrony
- Davidson et al. (2003): Meditation associated with left prefrontal
  activation and positive affect
- Meta-analyses support meditation-related EEG changes

Honest Assessment:
- Grinberg's specific findings are preliminary
- The broader field of meditation neuroscience provides moderate support
- "Transferred potential" claims remain highly controversial
- We present Grinberg's work honestly, noting both insights and limitations
```

### Self-Allusive Protocol

```
Grinberg's 6-Phase Structure:

Phase 1 - Settling: Ground initial awareness
Phase 2 - Body Awareness: Physical sensations, interoception
Phase 3 - Emotional Field: Emotions without losing body awareness
Phase 4 - Thought Awareness: Observing mental patterns
Phase 5 - Unified Field: All domains simultaneously ("high-inclusion")
Phase 6 - Integration: Grounding, return

Key Feature: Each phase ADDS to previous awareness rather than
replacing it. The unified field phase — holding body, emotion,
thought, and environment simultaneously — is distinctive.

This "additive" structure is what Grinberg termed "self-allusive":
awareness aware of its own structure.

## Step 2: Protocol Design

```markdown
# Morning Coherence Meditation

**Duration:** 20 minutes
**Level:** Beginner
**Evidence Level:** Preliminary (Grinberg EEG studies)

---

## Before You Begin

Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit. Set a timer for 20 minutes.

This meditation uses a progressive awareness technique. You don't
need prior meditation experience. If you feel disoriented at any
point, open your eyes, look around the room, and name 3 things
you can see.

**Not recommended** during acute mental health crisis or active
psychosis. This practice complements but does not replace
professional care.

---

## Phase 1: Settling (2-3 minutes)

Close your eyes or soften your gaze.

Take 3 deep breaths — in through the nose, out through the mouth.

Let your breathing return to normal. You're not trying to change
anything. Just arriving.

Notice where your body meets the chair or floor. This is your
anchor for the entire practice.

## Phase 2: Body Awareness (4-5 minutes)

Bring your attention to your body as a whole.

Notice temperature. Weight. Pressure where you're sitting.
Any tension. Any ease.

Don't try to fix anything. Just notice.

Slowly scan from feet to head, spending a breath or two at each
area. You're building an internal map of "what's here right now."

**Keep this awareness active as you move to the next phase.**

## Phase 3: Emotional Field (4-5 minutes)

Without losing the body awareness from Phase 2, now also notice
your emotional state.

What mood is present? Is it heavy? Light? Neutral? Mixed?

You don't need to name the emotion precisely. Just notice its
texture. Its location. Its weight.

**You are now holding TWO layers: body + emotion.**

## Phase 4: Thought Awareness (4-5 minutes)

Without losing body or emotion, now also notice your thoughts.

Watch them arrive and leave. You're not thinking the thoughts —
you're watching the thinking happen.

Some thoughts will be about the meditation. That's fine.
Observe those too.

**You are now holding THREE layers: body + emotion + thought.**

## Phase 5: Unified Field (3-4 minutes)

This is the distinctive phase.

Hold all three layers simultaneously: body sensations, emotional
tone, and thought patterns — all at once.

This may feel expansive or overwhelming. If overwhelming, return
to body awareness only.

You're not merging them. You're holding awareness of each while
attending to all. Grinberg called this "high-inclusion."

There is no target experience. Whatever you notice is the practice.

## Phase 6: Integration (2-3 minutes)

Slowly release the unified awareness.

Let your attention narrow back to just your body.

Feel your feet. Your hands. The chair beneath you.

Take 3 deliberate breaths.

Open your eyes slowly. Look around the room.

Take a full minute before standing.

---

## What You Might Notice

- A sense of spaciousness or expansion
- Difficulty holding multiple layers (normal — it develops with practice)
- Surprise at how busy or quiet the mind is
- Physical warmth or tingling
- Nothing remarkable (also valid — subtlety is the nature of the practice)

---

## Background

This practice is based on Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum's self-allusive
meditation protocol, developed at UNAM (Mexico) from the 1970s through
1994. His EEG studies suggested that this progressive awareness technique
may enhance interhemispheric coherence.

Evidence level is preliminary. We present this work honestly: the
insights are valuable, the research is limited, and independent
replication is needed.

## Disclaimer

This practice is for personal exploration, not medical treatment.
It complements but does not replace professional care. If you have
mental health concerns, consult your provider before beginning.
