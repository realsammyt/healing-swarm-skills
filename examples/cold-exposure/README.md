## What This Example Shows

1. **Research** - Cold adaptation physiology and safety evidence
2. **Protocol Design** - Level 1 cold finish protocol for beginners
3. **Safety Review** - Cardiovascular screening, afterdrop awareness
4. **Final Output** - Ready-to-use cold exposure introduction

## The Skill

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | `cold-finish-introduction` |
| **Purpose** | First cold exposure experience (cold shower finish) |
| **Level** | 1 — Cold Finish (gentlest entry) |
| **Evidence** | Moderate (cold water immersion studies) |

---

## Step 1: Research

### Cold Adaptation Physiology

```
Evidence Level: Moderate

Key Findings:
- Cold exposure activates the sympathetic nervous system
- Repeated exposure leads to cold habituation (reduced shivering,
  reduced perceived discomfort over weeks)
- Cold water immersion associated with increased noradrenaline
- Some evidence for mood improvement and stress resilience

Physiological Response:
- Initial "cold shock" response (gasp, hyperventilation)
- Vasoconstriction → blood shifts to core
- Noradrenaline and dopamine release
- Brown fat activation (with repeated exposure)

Afterdrop:
- Core temperature continues DROPPING after exiting cold water
- Cold blood from extremities returns to core
- Can cause shivering, dizziness, confusion
- Rewarming must be gradual

Safety Considerations:
- Cardiovascular stress (cold increases blood pressure)
- Screen for: heart conditions, Raynaud's, cold urticaria
- Never submerge head in cold water
- Never combine with full WHM breathing (hypocapnia + water = drowning risk)
```

### Progressive Levels

```
Level 1: Cold Finish — End warm shower with 15-30 seconds cold
Level 2: Extended Cold — Longer cold segments in shower (1-3 min)
Level 3: Cold First — Start shower cold (2-5 min)
Level 4: Cold Immersion — Ice bath or cold water body (2-10 min)
                          Partner MANDATORY at this level
```

## Step 2: Protocol Design

```markdown
# Cold Finish Introduction

**Type:** WHM Cold Exposure Protocol
**Level:** 1 — Cold Finish
**Duration:** 15-30 seconds of cold water
**Setting:** Normal warm shower at home
**Partner:** Recommended but not required at this level

---

## SAFETY CHECK

Before starting any cold exposure practice:

**Do NOT practice if you have:**
- Cardiovascular conditions (consult your doctor)
- Raynaud's disease
- Cold urticaria (cold allergy)
- Uncontrolled high blood pressure
- Recent heart surgery

**General rules:**
- Never submerge your head in cold water
- Never do full WHM breathing before cold exposure
- Listen to your body — there is no shame in stepping out early
- You can always try again tomorrow

---

## The Practice

### Warm Up First

Take your normal warm shower. Wash as usual. There's no rush.

When you're nearly done (and your body is warm), you're ready.

### The Cold Finish

**Turn the water to cold.**

Not the coldest setting. Just noticeably cool. You can adjust
colder over time.

**Stay for 15-30 seconds.**

You'll feel the cold shock: a gasp, maybe a desire to jump out.
This is normal. Focus on your exhale — slow, steady, out through
the mouth.

You don't need to stay longer than 30 seconds. This is an
introduction, not a test.

**Turn the water off. Step out.**

### After the Cold

1. Pat dry gently (don't rub vigorously)
2. Put on warm, dry clothes
3. Allow your body to rewarm naturally
4. No hot shower immediately after — let your body do the work
5. Notice how you feel over the next 20 minutes

---

## What You Might Notice

- A gasp when the cold hits (normal — the cold shock response)
- Skin tingling or redness (normal — vasoconstriction then dilation)
- Feeling alert and energized after (the noradrenaline response)
- A sense of accomplishment (you chose to do something uncomfortable)
- Shivering after (normal — your body generating heat)
- Not much at all (also fine — it builds with repetition)

---

## Progression

**Stay at Level 1 until:**
- Cold finishes feel manageable (not comfortable — manageable)
- You've done at least 7-10 sessions
- You want to go further (no pressure)

**Level 2 (Extended Cold):**
- Increase cold water time to 1-3 minutes
- Or alternate warm-cold-warm in the shower
- Still no head submersion

**There's no timeline.** Some people stay at Level 1 for months.
That's not failure — that's practice.

## Temperature Reference

| Level | Temperature |
|-------|------------|
| Cool | 20-15°C (68-59°F) |
| Cold | 15-10°C (59-50°F) |
| Very Cold | 10-5°C (50-41°F) |
| Ice | Below 5°C (41°F) |

Most home showers at their coldest are 10-15°C, which is
"Cold" — perfectly appropriate for Level 1-2.

---

## Background

Cold exposure as a practice appears across cultures: Nordic ice
swimming, Japanese misogi, Russian winter bathing, and Tibetan
Tummo. The Wim Hof Method provides a structured modern approach.

Research suggests that regular cold exposure may improve stress
resilience, mood, and immune function, though evidence varies by
outcome. The strongest evidence is for cold habituation and
acute noradrenaline release.

This practice is for informational purposes only. Cold exposure
carries real physiological risks. If you have ANY cardiovascular
conditions, consult your doctor before beginning. Stop immediately
if you feel chest pain, severe dizziness, or confusion.
