## What This Example Shows

This example walks through creating a WHM breathing session. It demonstrates:

1. **Research** - Gathering clinical evidence and tradition context
2. **Protocol Design** - Creating a safe breathing session
3. **Safety Review** - Ethics and physiological safety checks
4. **Final Output** - Ready-to-use breathing protocol

## The Skill We're Building

**Name:** `whm-morning-session`
**Purpose:** A beginner-friendly 3-round WHM breathing session
**Traditions:** Tummo (Tibetan inner heat), Pranayama (yogic breathing)
**Evidence:** Moderate (Kox et al. 2014, Muzik et al. 2018)

## Step 1: Research

### Clinical Evidence

From `research/clinical-evidence.md`:

```markdown
# WHM Breathwork Research: Clinical Evidence

## Evidence Level: Moderate (for immune modulation)

### Key Studies

**Kox et al. (2014) - PNAS**
- n=24 healthy male volunteers
- Trained WHM group vs. untreated control
- WHM group showed voluntary activation of sympathetic nervous system
- Attenuated innate immune response (lower pro-inflammatory cytokines)
- Limitations: small sample, male-only, short-term

**Muzik et al. (2018) - NeuroImage**
- Case study of Wim Hof + small group comparison
- fMRI and PET imaging during WHM practice
- Identified periaqueductal gray activation
- Suggests top-down regulation of innate immune response
- Limitations: very small sample, observational

### Physiological Mechanisms

- Controlled hyperventilation → respiratory alkalosis
- Breath retention → hypoxic stress response
- Sympathetic nervous system activation
- Possible adrenaline/noradrenaline release

### Safety Profile

- Syncope risk during breath retention (practice seated/lying)
- Drowning risk if practiced near water (CRITICAL)
- Hyperventilation can cause tingling, lightheadedness (expected)
- Contraindicated: cardiovascular conditions, epilepsy, pregnancy

### Evidence Statement

"Research suggests that WHM breathing practices may modulate the
innate immune response through voluntary sympathetic nervous system
activation. Evidence is moderate based on a well-designed but small
RCT and supporting neuroimaging studies."
```

### Tradition Context

From `research/tradition-context.md`:

```markdown
# WHM Breathwork Research: Tradition Context

## Tummo (Tibetan Inner Heat)

**Origin:** Tibetan Buddhist tantric practice
**Lineage:** Six Yogas of Naropa
**Core Concept:** Inner heat generation through breath, visualization,
and meditative absorption

The WHM breathing technique shares structural similarities with
Tummo practice but is NOT the same practice:
- Both use forceful breathing followed by retention
- Both generate measurable increases in body temperature
- Tummo includes visualization and spiritual framework
- WHM is presented as a secular physical practice

**Attribution:** WHM draws on principles found in Tummo while being
a distinct modern methodology. We honor the Tibetan Buddhist tradition
as the historical root without conflating the two practices.

## Pranayama (Yogic Breathing)

The breath retention aspect parallels pranayama techniques:
- Kumbhaka (breath retention) in classical yoga
- Bhastrika (bellows breath) for energizing
- Both traditions recognize breath as a bridge between
  voluntary and involuntary nervous system function
```

## Step 2: Protocol Design

From `content/morning-breathwork-session.md`:

```markdown
# Morning WHM Breathing Session

**Type:** Wim Hof Method Breathing Protocol
**Duration:** 15-20 minutes (3 rounds)
**Level:** Beginner
**Tradition:** Adapted from WHM; roots in Tummo and pranayama
**Evidence Level:** Moderate

---

## SAFETY BRIEFING (Read Before Every Session)

**NEVER** practice this breathing:
- In or near water (pools, baths, oceans)
- While driving or operating machinery
- While standing (sit or lie down)

**STOP** immediately if you experience:
- Chest pain
- Severe headache
- Panic or extreme anxiety
- Loss of consciousness (should not happen if seated)

**Contraindications:** Cardiovascular conditions, epilepsy,
pregnancy, recent surgery. Consult your doctor if unsure.

This practice is NOT medical treatment. Continue all prescribed care.

## The Session

### Settling (2 minutes)

Sit comfortably or lie on your back on a safe surface.
Close your eyes. Take 5 natural breaths.

Set your intention: you are here to breathe, nothing more.

### Round 1: Power Breaths + Retention

**30 Power Breaths:**
Breathe in deeply through your nose, filling your belly then chest.
Exhale naturally through your mouth — don't force the exhale.
Maintain a steady rhythm, about one breath every 2 seconds.

You may feel tingling in your hands or face. This is expected.

**Retention:**
After the 30th exhale, let the air go and HOLD.
Don't force it. Simply wait for the natural gasp reflex.
There is no target time. Your body will tell you when to breathe.

**Recovery Breath:**
When you feel the urge, take one deep breath in.
Hold for 15 seconds with lungs full.
Release and breathe normally for 30 seconds.

### Round 2: Power Breaths + Retention

Repeat the same process. You may notice:
- Retention feels longer (this is normal)
- More tingling or lightheadedness
- A sense of calm during retention

All of these are expected. If anything feels wrong, stop and
breathe normally.

### Round 3: Power Breaths + Retention

Final round. Same process.

Some people find the third round produces the deepest calm.
Others find it most challenging. Both are valid.

### Closing (2 minutes)

Breathe normally. Keep your eyes closed.
Notice how your body feels.
When ready, open your eyes slowly.

Take a full minute before standing up.

---

## What You Might Notice

- Tingling in hands, feet, or face (normal)
- Lightheadedness (normal — you're seated, so it's safe)
- Emotional release (tears, laughter — allow it)
- Deep calm during retention phase
- Energized feeling after session
- Nothing particular (also normal, especially early on)

---

## Background

This practice adapts principles found in Tibetan Tummo
(inner heat practice) and yogic pranayama (breath control).
The modern WHM format was developed by Wim Hof.

Research by Kox et al. (2014, PNAS) demonstrated that trained
practitioners could voluntarily influence their sympathetic
nervous system and immune response. Muzik et al. (2018)
identified brain mechanisms through neuroimaging.
