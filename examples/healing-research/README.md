## What This Example Shows

1. **Query Parsing** - Breaking down a research question
2. **Parallel Research** - Three agents working simultaneously
3. **Synthesis** - Combining findings into a unified brief
4. **Ethics Review** - Verifying all claims are appropriately qualified

## The Research Query

```bash
/healing-research "acupressure for hand ligament healing" --depth comprehensive
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Topic** | Acupressure for hand ligament healing |
| **Depth** | Comprehensive |
| **Traditions** | Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) |
| **Evidence** | Moderate (acupressure) / Limited (ligament-specific) |

---

## Step 1: Traditions Research

**Agent:** traditions-scholar

```markdown
# Traditional Background: Acupressure for Hand Healing

## Tradition: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)

**Origin:** ~2,000+ years, formalized in Huangdi Neijing
**Core Concept:** Qi flow through meridians; blockage causes pain/illness

### Relevant Meridians

Upper extremity meridians relevant to hand ligament healing:

| Meridian | Path | Primary Points |
|----------|------|---------------|
| Lung (LU) | Thumb side of forearm to thumb | LU-7, LU-9 |
| Large Intestine (LI) | Index finger to shoulder | LI-4, LI-5 |
| Heart (HT) | Armpit to little finger | HT-7 |
| Small Intestine (SI) | Little finger to shoulder | SI-3, SI-5 |
| Pericardium (PC) | Chest to middle finger | PC-6, PC-7 |
| San Jiao (SJ) | Ring finger to temple | SJ-5 |

### Key Acupoints for Hand Healing

**LI-4 (Hegu) — "Union Valley"**
- Location: Between thumb and index finger
- Traditional indication: All hand and face conditions
- Modern use: Pain relief, most-studied acupoint

**LI-5 (Yangxi) — "Yang Stream"**
- Location: Anatomical snuffbox
- Traditional indication: Wrist pain, tendon disorders

**SJ-5 (Waiguan) — "Outer Pass"**
- Location: Dorsal forearm, 2 cun above wrist
- Traditional indication: Pain, inflammation, stiffness

### Attribution

TCM acupressure theory as documented in classical texts
(Huangdi Neijing, c. 200 BCE). Specific point locations
follow WHO Standard Acupuncture Point Locations (2008).

## Step 2: Clinical Evidence

**Agent:** clinical-researcher

```markdown
# Clinical Evidence: Acupressure for Hand/Wrist Conditions

## Evidence Level: Moderate (for pain relief)
## Evidence Level: Limited (for ligament healing specifically)

### Acupressure for Pain Relief

**Systematic Reviews:**
- Chen & Wang (2014): Acupressure significantly reduced pain
  across multiple conditions. Moderate effect sizes.
- Au et al. (2015): Self-administered acupressure showed
  positive effects on chronic pain. Quality varied.

**Hand/Wrist Specific:**
- Limited direct evidence for ligament healing
- More evidence for carpal tunnel syndrome and wrist pain
- Most hand studies focus on LI-4 for general pain relief

### Mechanisms (Clinical Perspective)

- Pressure on acupoints may stimulate A-delta nerve fibers
- Gate control theory: pressure signals may inhibit pain signals
- Local pressure increases blood flow to the area
- Endorphin release reported in some studies

### Ligament Healing Considerations

- No RCTs specifically studying acupressure for ligament repair
- Increased local blood flow may theoretically support healing
- Manual pressure must be gentle — avoid re-injury
- Acupressure as complement to standard rehabilitation

### Safety for Hand Injuries

- Avoid direct pressure on acute injuries
- Wait until acute inflammation has resolved
- Gentle pressure only — never force through pain
- Complement to, not replacement for, medical treatment

### Evidence Statement

"Acupressure may help reduce pain in hand and wrist conditions,
with moderate evidence from systematic reviews. Direct evidence
for ligament healing is limited. Acupressure should complement
standard medical care, not replace it."

## Step 3: Mechanism Bridges

**Agent:** mechanisms-neuroscientist

```markdown
# Mechanism Bridges: TCM Meridians and Modern Physiology

## Bridging Framework

| TCM Concept | Modern Parallel | Evidence |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Qi flow | Peripheral blood flow | Moderate |
| Meridians | Fascial planes / nerve pathways | Emerging |
| Acupoint pressure | Mechanotransduction | Moderate |
| Stagnation | Inflammation / poor circulation | Moderate |
| Balance restoration | Homeostatic regulation | Theoretical |

## Key Bridges

**Qi → Blood Flow:**
TCM describes Qi stagnation causing pain. Modern research shows
that sustained pressure on specific points increases local blood
flow. Both frameworks agree on the importance of circulation for
healing, using different vocabulary.

**Meridians → Fascial Planes:**
Langevin & Yandow (2002) found 80% correspondence between
acupuncture meridians and fascial planes. This doesn't validate
the meridian model, but suggests the traditional map may reflect
real anatomical structures.

**Acupoint → Mechanotransduction:**
Pressure on tissue converts mechanical force to cellular signals.
This is well-established biology. Whether specific "acupoints"
are uniquely responsive remains debated.

## Honest Gaps

- We don't fully understand WHY acupoints seem to matter
- Meridian-fascial correspondence is suggestive, not proven
- Qi has no direct scientific equivalent
- The traditional framework and scientific framework are
  complementary maps, not identical territories

## Recommendation

Present both frameworks honestly. Don't reduce TCM to biomechanics
(that misses what makes it useful). Don't present Qi as science
(that overclaims). Let them illuminate each other.

## Step 4: Research Brief Synthesis

```markdown
# Research Brief: Acupressure for Hand Ligament Healing

## Executive Summary

Acupressure may support hand ligament healing as a complementary
practice alongside standard medical care. Evidence for pain relief
is moderate; evidence for accelerated ligament healing is limited.
TCM provides a well-developed framework for identifying treatment
points, with emerging scientific support for the underlying anatomy.

## Key Findings

- **Pain relief**: Moderate evidence supports acupressure for hand/wrist pain
- **Blood flow**: Pressure on acupoints increases local circulation
- **Ligament healing**: No direct RCT evidence; theoretical support only
- **Safety**: Generally safe when applied gently; avoid acute injury sites

## Evidence Level

| Claim | Level | Appropriate Language |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| Acupressure reduces pain | Moderate | "Research suggests" |
| Acupressure increases blood flow | Moderate | "Studies show" |
| Acupressure heals ligaments | Limited | "May theoretically support" |
| Meridians map to anatomy | Emerging | "Some evidence suggests" |

## Recommendations for Content

**Include:**
- LI-4, LI-5, SJ-5 as primary points for hand healing
- Gentle self-acupressure technique instructions
- "Complement to medical care" framing throughout
- TCM attribution with era and source texts

**Avoid:**
- Claims of healing or cure
- Pressure on acute injuries
- Replacing standard rehabilitation
- Reducing TCM to Western biomechanics

## Safety Considerations

- Wait for acute inflammation to resolve
- Gentle pressure only — pain means stop
- Not a replacement for splinting, PT, or medical care
- Consult healthcare provider if symptoms worsen

## What We Demonstrated

### Multi-Agent Coordination

- Clinical researcher evaluated the evidence honestly
- Mechanisms neuroscientist built bridges between frameworks

### Evidence Honesty

- Different evidence levels for different claims
- "Limited" evidence acknowledged directly
