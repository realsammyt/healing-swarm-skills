## What This Example Shows

1. **Exercise Selection** - Choosing Collective Label Delay for a team workshop
2. **Consent Framework** - Informed consent script and withdrawal rights
3. **Facilitation Guide** - Step-by-step facilitator script with troubleshooting
4. **Debrief Design** - Post-exercise questions and sharing guidelines

## The Exercise

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | `collective-label-delay` |
| **Purpose** | Team workshop exploring perception and language |
| **Participants** | 8 people |
| **Duration** | 10 minutes + 10-minute debrief |
| **Facilitator** | Required (not participating) |
| **Setting** | Team offsite / workshop |

## Step 1: Consent Framework

### Read Aloud Before Starting

> "This exercise involves looking at an object together in three phases:
> first naming it rapidly, then sitting in silence with it, then
> describing it using only sensations — not its name.
>
> You may notice shifts in how you perceive ordinary objects. This is
> expected and temporary.
>
> You are not expected to share your inner experience unless you choose
> to. You may stop participating at any time without explanation. There
> is no correct experience — whatever you notice is valid, including
> noticing nothing.
>
> Does everyone consent to participate?"

### Consent Checklist

- [ ] Script read aloud in full
- [ ] Each participant gives explicit verbal consent
- [ ] Observation-only option offered to anyone who declines
- [ ] No social pressure applied
- [ ] Facilitator is NOT also a participant

---

## Step 2: Setup

### Space

- Circle of chairs (8 people + facilitator standing/sitting outside)
- One shared object in center on a table (a stone, a cup, a plant)
- Quiet room with door closed
- Water available for all participants

### Materials

- Timer (phone on silent)
- The shared object
- Facilitator script (this document)
- Grounding protocol ready (Pocket Exit)

### Facilitator Preparation

- Read through the full exercise before facilitating
- Prepare Pocket Exit grounding protocol in case of distress
- Know when to pause or stop the exercise
- Have a quiet space available for anyone who needs to step out

## Step 3: The Exercise

### Phase 1: Name Storm (2 minutes)

**Facilitator says:**
"Look at this object. For the next two minutes, go around the circle.
Each person names it — any word that comes to mind. Speed matters.
Don't think, just name. We're going to flood the air with words."

**What happens:**
Participants rapidly generate names: "cup," "mug," "ceramic,"
"container," "cylinder," "vessel," "thing"...

**Facilitator watches for:** Engagement, laughter (normal), any
confusion about the instructions.

**Timer:** 2 minutes. Call time clearly.

### Phase 2: Silence (3 minutes)

**Facilitator says:**
"Now stop talking. Everyone look at the object in silence.
See past every name you just said. Don't try to do anything.
Just look."

**What happens:**
Silence. Some fidgeting (normal). Some people find the object
looks different after naming it so many times.

**Facilitator watches for:** Distress, someone wanting to leave
(let them go without comment), restlessness.

**Timer:** 3 minutes. Let the silence sit fully before breaking it.

### Phase 3: Texture Report (5 minutes)

**Facilitator says:**
"Now, go around the circle again. This time, describe the object
using ONLY sensations — temperature, weight, texture, how light
falls on it. Never use the object's name. If someone slips and
says the name, the group hums."

**What happens:**
Participants shift to sensory language: "cool surface," "catches
light on one side," "heavier than it looks," "rough near the
bottom"...

**Group humming signal:** If someone says "cup" or "mug," the
group hums gently. This is playful, not punitive.

**Facilitator watches for:** Difficulty shifting to sensory
language (offer prompts: "what temperature is it?"), anyone
getting frustrated (normalize: "this is harder than it seems").

**Timer:** 5 minutes.

---

## Step 4: Debrief (10 minutes)

### Guidelines (Read aloud)

> "Sharing is optional. No one is required to speak. If you do share,
> focus on what you noticed, not what you felt — 'I noticed the object
> looked different' rather than 'I felt strange.' There are no right
> or wrong observations."

### Questions

1. **Primary:** "What showed up in the silence that wasn't there during
   the naming?"
2. **Secondary:** "What was different about describing with sensations
   versus using the name?"
3. **Open:** "Anything else you want to name about that experience?"

### Facilitator Notes

**If no one shares:**
Offer one observation yourself: "I noticed that after all that naming,
the silence felt really full." Then sit with the quiet. Close gracefully
after 30 seconds.

**If someone shares something intense:**
Acknowledge without fixing: "Thank you for sharing that." Don't
interpret. Don't follow up unless they invite it.

**If someone dominates:**
"Thank you — let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet."

**Closing:**
"Thank you all. Language does a lot of invisible work. Today we
noticed a little bit of it. That's enough."

## What We Demonstrated

### Consent is Non-Negotiable
- Full consent script with explicit verbal agreement
- Observation-only option for anyone who declines
- Withdrawal without explanation at any time

### Facilitator as Guardian
- Facilitator does NOT participate (can't hold space and go deep)
- Troubleshooting table for common issues
- Distress protocol ready (Pocket Exit)

### Debrief Done Right
- Sharing optional, never required
- "What did you notice?" not "What did you feel?"
- No interpreting others' experiences
- Graceful close, not forced insight
