## Step 1: Research

Before creating content, we research the practice.

### Traditional Background

```
Tradition: Pranayama (Yogic Breathing)
Origin: Vedic tradition, Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (c. 400 CE)
Core Concept: Prana (life force/breath) as bridge between body and mind

Key Techniques:
- Nadi Shodhana (Alternate nostril breathing)
- Ujjayi (Victorious breath)
- Sama Vritti (Equal breathing)

Adaptation for Modern Use:
The 4-7-8 technique adapts traditional pranayama principles:
- Inhale 4 counts
- Hold 7 counts
- Exhale 8 counts

Attribution: This adaptation draws on classical pranayama as
documented in the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and Yoga Sutras.
```

### Clinical Evidence

```
Evidence Level: Moderate

Key Findings:
- Slow breathing (6 breaths/min) increases HRV
- Controlled breathing reduces state anxiety
- Effects appear within single session

Representative Studies:
- Zaccaro et al. (2018) - Review of 15 studies on slow breathing
- Ma et al. (2017) - Diaphragmatic breathing and stress (n=40)

Limitations:
- Most studies have small sample sizes
- Protocol variations make comparison difficult
- Mechanism pathways not fully established

Safety:
- Generally safe for healthy adults
- Contraindications: severe respiratory conditions
- Stop if lightheaded
```

## Step 2: Content Creation

Based on research, the content is created:

```markdown
# 5-Minute Calm Breath

**Type:** Guided Breathing Meditation
**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Tradition:** Adapted from yogic pranayama principles
**Evidence Level:** Moderate

---

## Before You Begin

Find a comfortable position---sitting or lying down.
This practice is gentle and you can stop at any time.

**Note:** If you have respiratory conditions, consult
your healthcare provider before practicing.

---

## The Practice

### Settling In (30 seconds)

Let your eyes close gently, or soften your gaze downward.
Take a moment to arrive.

### Natural Breath (1 minute)

Begin by simply noticing your natural breath.
You don't need to change anything. Just observe.

### Extending the Exhale (2.5 minutes)

**Inhale** through your nose for a count of 4.
**Hold** gently for a count of 7.
**Exhale** slowly through your mouth for a count of 8.

Repeat 3-4 times.

If the counts feel too long, shorten them proportionally.
The ratio matters more than the numbers.

### Returning (1 minute)

Let go of the counting.
Allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm.
When ready, let your eyes open gently.

---

## If You Feel Lightheaded

Stop the counted breathing and breathe normally.
This means you should shorten your counts next time.

---

## Background

This practice adapts extended exhale principles from yogic
pranayama (Yoga Sutras, c. 400 CE). Research suggests slow
breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system.
