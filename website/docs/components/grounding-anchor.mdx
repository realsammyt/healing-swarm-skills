# GroundingAnchor

A grounding component for language awareness and deautomatization practices. Provides step-by-step guided grounding when users need to return to ordinary awareness. Includes both the quick Pocket Exit protocol and the full Reintegration Ritual.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Always accessible**: Available at any point during a practice session
- **Two modes**: Quick grounding (Pocket Exit) and full grounding (Reintegration Ritual)
- **Multi-sensory**: Combines touch, sight, breath, speech for reliable grounding
- **Not dismissable during active practice**: Remains available until language feels normal
- **Calm, non-urgent tone**: Grounding is a return, not an emergency

## Grounding Protocols

### Pocket Exit (Quick — 30 seconds)

| Step | Instruction | Sense |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Tongue tip to roof of mouth, behind front teeth | Touch |
| 2 | Left thumb to sternum center, press lightly | Touch |
| 3 | Breathe: in for 4 heartbeats, out for 6 | Breath |
| 4 | Look at nearest object — name it deliberately | Sight + Speech |
| 5 | Say one useful number aloud | Speech + Cognition |

### Reintegration Ritual (Full — 2-3 minutes)

| Step | Instruction | Sense |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Open both eyes wide | Sight |
| 2 | Wiggle toes, stretch fingers into unfamiliar shapes | Movement |
| 3 | Touch the back of your neck | Touch |
| 4 | Name 5 things you see, 4 you touch, 3 you hear | Multi-sensory |
| 5 | Say one useful number aloud | Speech + Cognition |
| 6 | Wait until language feels normal before moving on | Self-check |

## Props

```typescript
interface GroundingAnchorProps {
  mode: 'pocket-exit' | 'reintegration' | 'auto';
  onComplete?: () => void;
  onStepChange?: (step: number, total: number) => void;
  autoAdvance?: boolean;         // Auto-advance between steps
  stepDuration?: number;         // Seconds per step if auto-advancing
  showProgress?: boolean;        // Show step progress indicator
  size?: 'compact' | 'full';    // Compact for floating, full for dedicated view
  audioGuided?: boolean;         // Audio instructions for each step
}
```

## Usage

### Floating Emergency Button

```tsx
<GroundingAnchor
  mode="pocket-exit"
  size="compact"
  onComplete={() => setGrounded(true)}
/>
```

### Full-Screen Return Protocol

```tsx
<GroundingAnchor
  mode="reintegration"
  size="full"
  autoAdvance={true}
  stepDuration={20}
  audioGuided={true}
  onComplete={() => navigateToSafety()}
/>
```

### Auto-Select Based on Context

```tsx
<GroundingAnchor
  mode="auto"  // Uses pocket-exit for mild, reintegration for strong disorientation
  onComplete={() => resumeOrExit()}
/>
```

## Accessibility

- Large touch targets (minimum 48px)
- High contrast text and indicators
- Screen reader step-by-step narration
- Works with eyes closed (audio mode)
- No reliance on color alone for progress

## Integration with Language Awareness

This component is designed to pair with language awareness practice tools:

- **Before practice**: Teach the Pocket Exit as preparation
- **During practice**: Float as emergency return button
- **After practice**: Run full grounding return sequence
- **If distressed**: Auto-triggers full Reintegration Ritual
