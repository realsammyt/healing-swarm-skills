# BreathworkTimer

A specialized timer component for Wim Hof Method breathing sessions. Designed with safety as the primary constraint — includes mandatory safety briefing, phase-aware displays, and a retention timer that counts UP (not down) to prevent competitive breath-holding.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Safety briefing gate**: Cannot be skipped. Users must acknowledge safety warnings before starting
- **Retention counts UP**: Elapsed time display prevents targeting specific hold times
- **No countdown pressure**: The gasp reflex determines when to breathe, not a timer
- **Phase-aware UI**: Visual design changes with each breathing phase
- **Audio cues**: Optional haptic and audio feedback for phase transitions

## Phases

| Phase | Display | Interaction |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Safety Briefing | Warnings, acknowledge button | Must accept to proceed |
| Settling | Calm animation, countdown | Automatic transition |
| Power Breaths | Breath counter, rhythm guide | Visual/audio rhythm cue |
| Retention | Elapsed time counting UP | Tap to end when ready |
| Recovery Breath | 15-second hold indicator | Automatic countdown |
| Rest | Rest timer between rounds | Automatic transition |
| Closing | Session summary | Review and close |

## Props

```typescript
interface BreathworkTimerProps {
  rounds: number;           // Number of rounds (default: 3)
  breathsPerRound: number;  // Power breaths per round (default: 30)
  breathPace: number;       // Seconds per breath cycle (default: 2)
  recoveryHold: number;     // Recovery hold seconds (default: 15)
  restBetweenRounds: number; // Rest seconds (default: 30)
  settlingDuration: number;  // Settling seconds (default: 120)
  level: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  onPhaseChange?: (phase: Phase) => void;
  onSessionComplete?: (summary: SessionSummary) => void;
  audioEnabled?: boolean;
  hapticEnabled?: boolean;
}
```

## Session Summary

After completion, the timer provides:

```typescript
interface SessionSummary {
  totalDuration: number;      // Total session time
  rounds: RoundSummary[];     // Per-round data
  retentionTimes: number[];   // Retention durations (for personal tracking)
  completed: boolean;
}
```

## Accessibility

- Screen reader announces phase transitions
- Keyboard controls: Space to start/stop, Escape to exit
- High contrast phase indicators
- Audio cues for eyes-closed practice
- Reduced motion mode available

## Safety Architecture

The component enforces these safety rules:

1. **Safety briefing is non-skippable** — first-time users see full briefing; returning users see abbreviated version
2. **Retention timer counts UP** — no target, no countdown, no competitive framing
3. **"Tap when ready" for retention** — user decides when to breathe, not the timer
4. **Emergency stop** — always accessible, returns to normal breathing guidance
5. **Session does not auto-advance** during retention — user must actively choose to breathe

## Usage

```tsx
<BreathworkTimer
  rounds={3}
  level="beginner"
  audioEnabled={true}
  onSessionComplete={(summary) => {
    console.log('Session complete:', summary);
  }}
/>
```
