# EvidenceCitation

Display research findings, scientific studies, and traditional knowledge with clear evidence levels, proper attribution, and transparent limitations.

## Purpose

The `EvidenceCitation` component ensures intellectual honesty when presenting healing research by:
- Making evidence quality immediately visible
- Providing full citation information
- Highlighting study limitations
- Linking to original sources

## Evidence Levels

### Strong Evidence
- Multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
- Consistent results across studies
- Large sample sizes
- **Badge color**: Green

### Moderate Evidence
- Some quality studies with mostly consistent results
- May include observational studies
- Smaller sample sizes or shorter duration
- **Badge color**: Blue

### Preliminary Evidence
- Limited studies or mixed results
- Small sample sizes
- Early-stage research
- Needs replication
- **Badge color**: Gold

### Traditional Knowledge
- Historical use in traditional healing systems
- May lack modern scientific validation
- Based on cultural wisdom and generations of practice
- **Badge color**: Dark gold

## Code Examples

### Basic Usage

```mdx
import { EvidenceCitation } from '@site/src/components/healing';

<EvidenceCitation
  level="strong"
  title="Exercise for Depression Treatment"
  author="Cooney GM, et al."
  date="2013"
  snippet="Exercise appears to improve depressive symptoms in people with a diagnosis of depression."
  sampleSize={1356}
/>
```

### With All Props

```mdx
<EvidenceCitation
  level="moderate"
  title="Yoga for Lower Back Pain"
  author="Wieland LS, et al."
  date="2017"
  domain="Complementary Medicine"
  snippet="There is low- to moderate-certainty evidence that yoga compared to non-exercise controls results in small to moderate improvements in back-related function at three and six months."
  sampleSize={1080}
  limitations="High heterogeneity in yoga interventions; difficulty in blinding participants"
  sourceUrl="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28436583/"
  className="my-8"
/>
```

### Traditional Knowledge Citation

```mdx
<EvidenceCitation
  level="traditional"

```

## Accessibility Features

- **Semantic HTML**: Uses `<article>` role with proper heading structure
- **ARIA labels**: Descriptive labels for screen readers
- **Keyboard navigation**: Source links are keyboard accessible
- **Focus indicators**: Clear visual focus states
- **Time elements**: Dates use semantic `<time>` tags
- **Color contrast**: All text meets WCAG AA standards

## Best Practices

:::tip When to Use
- Presenting research findings in skill documentation
- Citing sources for healing technique claims
- Showing evidence quality for treatment recommendations
- Documenting traditional knowledge with proper context
:::

:::warning Important
- Always include limitations for preliminary research
- Link to original sources when available
- Be honest about evidence quality - don't oversell traditional knowledge as "proven"
- Update citations as new research emerges
:::

## Styling Customization

The component uses Tailwind classes and can be customized:

```mdx
<EvidenceCitation
  level="strong"
  title="Research Title"
  snippet="Key finding..."
  className="border-4 shadow-xl"
/>
```
