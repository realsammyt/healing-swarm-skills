# SafetyConsent

A dialog component for obtaining informed consent before users engage with healing practices. Ensures users understand risks, limitations, and proper usage.

## Purpose

The `SafetyConsent` component provides:
- Medical and legal disclaimers
- Contraindication warnings
- Informed consent acknowledgment
- Ethical protection for users and providers
- Documentation of user understanding

## Live Demo

DO NOT practice if you have any of the following conditions:
• Cardiovascular problems or heart disease

      </div>
    );
  }
  return (
    <div className="my-8">
      <SafetyConsent
        title="Traditional Practice Acknowledgment"
        body="This practice is drawn from Traditional Chinese Medicine, which has been used therapeutically for thousands of years within specific cultural and theoretical frameworks.

While TCM is widely practiced and has been studied scientifically, it represents a different paradigm from Western biomedicine. Some concepts (like Qi, meridians, and organ systems) may not have direct equivalents in modern anatomy and physiology.

The effectiveness of this practice is supported by traditional knowledge and some clinical research, but individual results may vary. This should complement, not replace, conventional medical care when appropriate."
        checkboxLabel="I understand this practice comes from a traditional healing system and represents one approach among many"
        confirmLabel="Continue to Practice"
        onConfirm={() => setShowPractice(true)}

## Code Examples

### Basic Medical Disclaimer

```mdx
import { SafetyConsent } from '@site/src/components/healing';

<SafetyConsent
  title="Medical Disclaimer"
  body="This information is for educational purposes only..."
  onConfirm={() => showPractice()}
/>
```

### With Contraindications

```mdx
<SafetyConsent
  title="Safety Warning"
  body="DO NOT practice if you have:
• Heart conditions
• High blood pressure
• Pregnancy

Always consult your doctor before starting new practices."
  checkboxLabel="I confirm I do not have these contraindications"
  confirmLabel="I'm Safe to Practice"
  cancelLabel="Not for Me"
  onConfirm={() => enablePractice()}
  onCancel={() => suggestAlternatives()}
/>
```

### React Integration

```tsx
import { SafetyConsent } from '@site/src/components/healing';
import { useState } from 'react';

function ProtectedPractice() {
  const [hasConsented, setHasConsented] = useState(false);

  if (!hasConsented) {
    return (
      <SafetyConsent
        title="Important Safety Information"
        body="This practice involves..."
        onConfirm={() => setHasConsented(true)}
        onCancel={() => window.history.back()}
      />
    );
  }

  return <PracticeContent />;
}
```

### With Session Storage

```tsx
function PersistentConsent() {
  const [hasConsented, setHasConsented] = useState(() => {
    return sessionStorage.getItem('breathwork-consent') === 'true';
  });

  const handleConfirm = () => {
    sessionStorage.setItem('breathwork-consent', 'true');
    setHasConsented(true);
  };

  if (!hasConsented) {
    return (
      <SafetyConsent
        title="Breathwork Safety"
        body="..."
        onConfirm={handleConfirm}
      />
    );
  }

  return <BreathworkPractice />;
}
```

## Accessibility Features

  - `Space` / `Enter`: Toggle checkbox, activate buttons
  - `Esc`: Cancel (if cancel button provided)
- **Screen reader announcements**:
  - Title read as dialog heading

## Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

:::info Writing Disclaimers
- **Be specific**: List actual contraindications, not vague warnings
- **Be clear**: Use simple language, avoid jargon
- **Be honest**: Don't oversell or undersell risks
- **Be actionable**: Tell users what to do (consult doctor, stop if X happens)
- **Be concise**: Long disclaimers aren't read; keep essential points
:::

### Legal Protection

:::warning Not Legal Advice
This component helps with informed consent but doesn't constitute legal protection. Consult a lawyer about liability for your specific use case.
:::

### Ethical Requirements

**Always include SafetyConsent for:**
- Practices that could cause physical harm if done incorrectly
- Techniques contraindicated for medical conditions
- Practices that could trigger psychological distress
- Traditional practices you're not qualified to teach professionally
- Content where misuse could cause harm

**Consider including SafetyConsent for:**
- Dietary or supplement recommendations
- Exercise or movement practices
- Breathwork or meditation techniques
- Practices requiring supervision
- Content targeting vulnerable populations

## User Experience

### Consent Flow

1. **Present disclaimer**: User encounters warning before content
2. **Read content**: User reads safety information
3. **Acknowledge**: User checks acknowledgment box
4. **Enable action**: Confirm button becomes active
5. **Proceed**: User confirms and accesses content

### Reducing Friction

Balance safety with user experience:
- **Session persistence**: Don't require consent every page visit
- **Clear labeling**: Users know what they're consenting to
- **Cancel option**: Users can opt out if practice isn't for them
- **Respectful tone**: Not fear-mongering, just honest safety info

## Visual Design

### Warning Aesthetic

- **Border**: Yellow-orange warning color
- **Icon**: Triangle warning symbol
- **Background**: Dark neutral with warning border
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with bold title

### State Transitions

- **Unacknowledged**: Confirm button disabled, gray, muted
- **Acknowledged**: Confirm button enabled, green, glowing
- **Hover states**: Subtle feedback on interactive elements
- **Focus states**: Clear keyboard focus indicators

## Related Components

- [EvidenceCitation](./evidence-citation) - Cite safety research
- [TraditionAttribution](./tradition-attribution) - Context for traditional practices
- [HealingProgress](./healing-progress) - Guide users after consent

## Technical Notes

### Paragraph Parsing

Body text supports paragraphs via double newlines:

```tsx
body="First paragraph.

Second paragraph.

Third paragraph."
```

Internally split by `\n\n` and rendered as separate `<p>` tags.

### State Management

Component manages checkbox state internally, but calls external `onConfirm`/`onCancel` callbacks for parent component integration.

### Persistence Strategies

Consider these approaches for multi-page consent:

```tsx
// Session storage (current session only)
sessionStorage.setItem('consent-key', 'true');

// Local storage (persists across sessions)
localStorage.setItem('consent-key', 'true');

// Cookie (with expiration)
document.cookie = "consent=true; max-age=31536000";

// Database (for logged-in users)
await saveUserConsent(userId, practiceId);
```
