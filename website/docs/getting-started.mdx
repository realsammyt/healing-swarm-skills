---

# Getting Started

Choose your path:

- **[I Want to Explore](#i-want-to-explore)** - Learn what healing applications look like
- **[I Want to Add Healing to My Existing Project](#i-want-to-add-healing-to-my-existing-project)** - Analyze and enhance your app, game, or website
- **[I Want to Build](#i-want-to-build)** - Set up your environment and create new healing tools

---

## I Want to Explore

### What Healing Applications Look Like

The Healing Swarm creates applications that combine:

**Traditional Wisdom**
- Practices documented across cultures and centuries
- Proper attribution to source traditions
- Context preserved, not stripped

**Clinical Evidence**
- Research summaries with appropriate confidence levels
- "May help" language, never "will cure"
- Limitations acknowledged

**Ethical Guardrails**
- Medical disclaimers where needed
- Psychological safety (grounding techniques, exit ramps)
- Accessibility for all users

### Example: 5-Minute Breathing Meditation

Here's what the swarm produces—a complete meditation script:

```markdown
# 5-Minute Calm Breath

Type: Guided Breathing Meditation
Duration: 5 minutes
Tradition: Adapted from yogic pranayama principles
Evidence Level: Moderate

---

## Before You Begin

Find a comfortable position. This practice is gentle
and you can stop at any time.

Note: If you have respiratory conditions, consult
your healthcare provider before practicing.

---

## The Practice

### Settling In (30 seconds)

Let your eyes close gently. Take a moment to arrive.
There's nothing to do right now except be here.

### Natural Breath (1 minute)

Simply notice your natural breath. You don't need
to change anything. Just observe.

### Extending the Exhale (2.5 minutes)

Inhale through your nose for a count of 4.
Hold gently for a count of 7.
Exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of 8.

Repeat 3-4 times.

### Returning (1 minute)

Let your breath return to its natural rhythm.
When ready, let your eyes open gently.

---

## Disclaimer

This practice is for informational purposes only and
does not replace professional medical or psychological care.
```

Notice the elements:
- **Medical disclaimer** at start and end
- **Permission to stop** built in
- **Tradition named** with era
- **Evidence language** appropriate to confidence level
- **Grounding technique** (lightheadedness guidance)

## I Want to Add Healing to My Existing Project

Have an app, website, game, or narrative that could be more healing? The HEAL Assessment analyzes your codebase and recommends where to add wellness properties.

### The HEAL Framework

| Letter | Looks For | Examples |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **H** | Harsh Interactions | Cold error messages, abrupt rejections, punishing feedback |
| **E** | Emotional Blind Spots | Missing acknowledgments, no celebration, cold confirmations |
| **A** | Accessibility Gaps | Keyboard traps, missing labels, poor contrast, no screen reader support |
| **L** | Lost Opportunities | Places where breathing space, pacing, or encouragement could exist |

### Quick Start

**Step 1: Run the Analysis**

In your project directory:

```bash
claude -p "Using the healing-swarm project analysis skill, perform a
HEAL assessment of this codebase. Focus on error handling, user
feedback, loading states, forms, and accessibility. Provide a
prioritized report with specific files and recommendations."
```

**Step 2: Review Recommendations**

The analysis returns:
- Severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Specific file locations and line numbers
- Current problematic patterns
- Recommended healing integrations
- Implementation difficulty estimates

**Step 3: Implement High-Impact Changes**

Start with critical and high-severity findings:

| Finding | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Harsh error messages | Use [Gentle Errors](/docs/integration/gentle-errors) pattern |
| Missing breathing room | Add [Breathing Spaces](/docs/integration/breathing-spaces) |
| Cold confirmations | Use [Mindful Interactions](/docs/integration/mindful-interactions) |
| Accessibility issues | Apply [Accessibility Healing](/docs/integration/accessibility-healing) |

### By Project Type

| Project Type | Start With | Key Patterns |
|--------------|------------|--------------|
| **Web Apps** | Gentle Errors | UI Wellness, Ethical Data |
| **Mobile Apps** | Project Analysis | Breathing Spaces, Accessibility |
| **Video Games** | [Game Healing](/docs/integration/game-healing) | Adaptive difficulty, restorative spaces |
| **Interactive Stories** | [Narrative Healing](/docs/integration/narrative-healing) | Safe spaces, emotional pacing |
| **Apps with Engagement** | [Healing Gamification](/docs/integration/healing-gamification) | Compassionate streaks, meaningful progress |

### Example: Transforming an Error State

**Before:**
```tsx
{error && <p className="error">{error}</p>}
```

**After:**
```tsx
import { GentleError } from '@/components/integration';

{error && (
  <GentleError
    message="Something unexpected happened"
    explanation={error}
    suggestions={['Try again', 'Contact support']}
    tone="apologetic"
  />
)}
```

### Next Steps for Upgrading

1. [Full Project Analysis Guide](/docs/integration/project-analysis) - Detailed prompts and templates
2. [Integration Patterns](/docs/integration) - All available healing patterns
3. [Components Reference](/docs/components) - Drop-in React components

## I Want to Build

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Minimum Version | Check Command |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Node.js | 18.0.0+ | `node --version` |
| Git | 2.30.0+ | `git --version` |
| Claude Code | Latest | `claude --version` |

### Installation

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/realsammyt/healing-swarm-skills.git
cd healing-swarm-skills
```

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

**Step 3: Validate Installation**

```bash
npm run validate
```

You should see:
```
Validating skill structure...
Checking ethics guardrails...
Verifying workflows...
All 44 skill files validated successfully
```

**Step 4: Copy Skills to Claude Code**

macOS/Linux:
```bash
cp -r .claude/skills/healing-swarm ~/.claude/skills/
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse .claude\skills\healing-swarm $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\
```

**Step 5: Verify Skills**

Open Claude Code and type `/`. You should see:
- `/healing-research`
- `/healing-design`
- `/healing-content`
- `/healing-build`
- `/healing-review`
- `/healing-deploy`
- `/healing-swarm`

### Your First Skill

Try the research skill:

```bash
claude> /healing-research "breathwork for stress relief"
```

Watch how it:
1. Parses your query
2. Coordinates multiple research agents
3. Produces a comprehensive research brief
4. Applies ethics review

### Create Your Own Skill

```bash
npm run create-skill
```

The interactive CLI walks you through:
- Skill name and trigger
- Which template to use
- Agent configuration
- Workflow setup

### Validate Your Changes

Before committing:

```bash
npm run validate
npm run check:ethics
```
