# Integration Patterns

**Healing properties for every project.** These patterns help you weave wellness, mindfulness, and ethical design into any codebase—regardless of its primary purpose.

---

## The Philosophy

Digital products shape human experience. Every error message, loading state, and interaction either adds stress or creates space for breath. Integration patterns help you choose healing.

```
Traditional Approach          Healing Integration
─────────────────────         ─────────────────────
"Error 500"           →       "Something unexpected happened.
                               Take a breath—we're on it."

[Loading spinner]     →       "Preparing your experience...
                               (A moment to settle)"

"Are you sure?"       →       "You're about to [action].
                               Take a moment if needed."
```

### [Mindful Interactions](/docs/integration/mindful-interactions)
**Effort: Medium | Impact: High**

Add intentional pauses and awareness moments to high-stakes interactions.

- Breathing pauses before actions
- Mindful transitions
- Pacing controls
- Reflection moments

### [Gentle Errors](/docs/integration/gentle-errors)
**Effort: Low | Impact: Medium**

Transform harsh error states into supportive recovery experiences.

- Compassionate messaging
- Actionable suggestions
- Recovery guidance
- Stress reduction

### [Accessibility Healing](/docs/integration/accessibility-healing)
**Effort: Medium | Impact: High**

Accessibility as an act of inclusion and healing. Go beyond compliance to genuine welcome.

- Keyboard navigation
- Cognitive accessibility
- Motion sensitivity

### [Ethical Data](/docs/integration/ethical-data)
**Effort: Medium | Impact: High**

Respectful data practices that build trust and honor user autonomy.

- Transparent collection
- Informed consent
- Easy deletion
- Minimal footprint

## Integration Components

Drop-in components for immediate healing integration:

```tsx
import {
  BreathePause,      // Intentional pause before action
  GentleError,       // Compassionate error states
  WellbeingCheck,    // Periodic wellness check-ins
  MindfulTransition, // Aware state changes
  CalmLoading,       // Peaceful loading states
  SafetyGate         // Consent before sensitive content
} from '@/components/integration';
```

## Principles of Integration

### 1. Additive, Not Intrusive
Healing integration should enhance existing functionality, not obstruct it. Users can always proceed quickly if they choose.

### 2. Context-Appropriate
A meditation app and a stock trading app need different healing intensities. Match the approach to user expectations and context.

### 3. Measurably Beneficial
Track user satisfaction, task completion rates, and stress indicators. Good integration improves metrics.

### 4. Ethically Sound
Healing is not a dark pattern. Never use calming design to mask problems or manipulate decisions.

### 5. Incrementally Adoptable
Start with one pattern. Expand as you see results. Perfect integration that never ships helps no one.

## Getting Started

1. **Assess** - Use the [Integration Checklist](/docs/skills/integration#integration-checklist) to identify opportunities
2. **Choose** - Pick one pattern that addresses your biggest pain point
3. **Implement** - Follow the pattern guide and use provided components
4. **Measure** - Track impact on user experience metrics
5. **Expand** - Add more patterns based on results

## Swarm Assistance

Use healing swarm agents to accelerate integration:

```bash
# Analyze project for opportunities
claude -p "Analyze this React codebase for healing integration
opportunities. Prioritize by impact and effort."

# Generate pattern implementation
claude -p "Implement the Gentle Errors pattern for this Express.js
API. Include client-side components and server responses."

# Review existing integration
claude -p "Review the healing integration in this project.
Check for consistency, accessibility, and ethical alignment."
```

*"The goal isn't to make every app a wellness app—it's to ensure no app makes things worse."*
