# Integration Patterns

**Add healing properties to any project.** Whether you're building from scratch or enhancing an existing codebase, these patterns help you weave wellness, mindfulness, and ethical design into apps, games, narratives, and any digital experience.

---

## The Philosophy

Digital products shape human experience. Every error message, loading state, and interaction either adds stress or creates space for breath. Integration patterns help you choose healing.

```
Traditional Approach          Healing Integration
─────────────────────         ─────────────────────
"Error 500"           →       "Something unexpected happened.
                               Take a breath—we're on it."

[Loading spinner]     →       "Preparing your experience...
                               (A moment to settle)"

"Are you sure?"       →       "You're about to [action].
                               Take a moment if needed."
```

## Integration Components

Drop-in components for immediate healing integration:

```tsx
import {
  // Core integration
  BreathePause,         // Intentional pause before action
  GentleError,          // Compassionate error states
  WellbeingCheck,       // Periodic wellness check-ins
  MindfulTransition,    // Aware state changes
  CalmLoading,          // Peaceful loading states

  // Gamification
  HealingJourney,       // Progress visualization with milestones
  ProgressCelebration,  // Mindful achievement recognition

  // Narrative
  NarrativeChoice,      // Emotion-coded story choices
  SafeSpace,            // In-experience grounding refuge
} from '@/components/integration';
```

## Principles of Integration

### 1. Additive, Not Intrusive
Healing integration should enhance existing functionality, not obstruct it. Users can always proceed quickly if they choose.

### 2. Context-Appropriate
A meditation app and a stock trading app need different healing intensities. Match the approach to user expectations and context.

### 3. Measurably Beneficial
Track user satisfaction, task completion rates, and stress indicators. Good integration improves metrics.

### 4. Ethically Sound
Healing is not a dark pattern. Never use calming design to mask problems or manipulate decisions.

### 5. Incrementally Adoptable
Start with one pattern. Expand as you see results. Perfect integration that never ships helps no one.

## Getting Started

### For New Projects
1. **Choose** - Pick patterns that match your project type from the matrix above
2. **Design** - Incorporate healing principles from the start
3. **Implement** - Use provided components and guidelines
4. **Measure** - Track impact on user experience metrics

### For Existing Projects
1. **Analyze** - Run [Project Analysis](/docs/integration/project-analysis) to identify opportunities
2. **Prioritize** - Focus on high-impact, low-effort improvements first
3. **Implement** - Start with Gentle Errors or Breathing Spaces
4. **Iterate** - Add more patterns based on results

## Swarm Assistance

Use healing swarm agents to accelerate integration:

```bash
# Analyze project for opportunities
claude -p "Analyze this React codebase for healing integration
opportunities. Prioritize by impact and effort."

# Generate pattern implementation
claude -p "Implement the Gentle Errors pattern for this Express.js
API. Include client-side components and server responses."

# Review existing integration
claude -p "Review the healing integration in this project.
Check for consistency, accessibility, and ethical alignment."
```

*"The goal isn't to make every app a wellness app—it's to ensure no app makes things worse."*
