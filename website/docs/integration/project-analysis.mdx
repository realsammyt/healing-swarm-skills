# Project Analysis Skill

**Let AI agents identify healing opportunities in any project.** This skill provides structured prompts, analysis patterns, and reporting templates for systematically evaluating codebases and recommending healing integrations.

---

## Overview

The Project Analysis skill enables healing swarm agents to:

1. **Scan** - Examine codebase structure, patterns, and user flows
2. **Identify** - Find stress points, harsh interactions, and missed opportunities
3. **Recommend** - Suggest specific healing integrations with priority
4. **Generate** - Produce implementation code and migration plans

---

## Quick Start

### Analyze Any Project

```bash
# Clone the target project
git clone https://github.com/example/target-project
cd target-project

# Run healing analysis with Claude
claude -p "Using the healing-swarm project analysis skill, perform a
comprehensive healing opportunity assessment of this codebase.

Focus on:
1. Error handling patterns
2. User feedback mechanisms
3. Loading and waiting states
4. Form interactions
5. Accessibility gaps
6. Data consent flows

Generate a prioritized report with specific file locations and
recommended healing integrations."
```

---

## Analysis Framework

### The HEAL Assessment Model

```
H - Harsh Interactions
    └── Error messages, validation feedback, rejection states

E - Emotional Blind Spots
    └── Missing acknowledgments, cold confirmations, abrupt transitions

A - Accessibility Gaps
    └── Keyboard traps, missing labels, poor contrast, no motion control

L - Lost Opportunities
    └── Places where breathing space, celebration, or care could exist
```

### Severity Scoring

| Level | Impact | Examples |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Critical** | Causes user distress | Harsh error shaming, data loss without warning |
| **High** | Significant stress | Cold rejections, confusing flows, accessibility blocks |
| **Medium** | Missed opportunity | No success celebration, abrupt transitions |
| **Low** | Enhancement | Could add breathing space, gentle loading |

## Agent Prompts

### Comprehensive Analysis Prompt

```markdown
# Healing Opportunity Analysis

You are a healing integration specialist analyzing a codebase for opportunities
to add wellness, mindfulness, and ethical design patterns.

## Your Task

Analyze this codebase systematically and produce a healing opportunity report.

## Analysis Areas

### 1. Error Handling Audit
Scan for:
- Error message tone (harsh vs supportive)
- Recovery guidance (present vs absent)
- Technical jargon exposure to users
- Blame language ("You failed to..." vs "We couldn't...")

Files to check: **/error*, **/exception*, components with "error" in name,
catch blocks, .catch() handlers

### 2. User Feedback Assessment
Scan for:
- Success state celebrations (or lack thereof)
- Loading state messaging
- Empty state communication
- Form validation feedback tone

Files to check: **/components/*, **/pages/*, forms, modals, notifications

### 3. Transition Analysis
Scan for:
- Abrupt state changes
- Missing confirmation dialogs
- Instant irreversible actions
- Context switches without preparation

Files to check: navigation, routing, state management, delete/remove actions

### 4. Accessibility Healing
Scan for:
- Missing ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation gaps
- Color contrast issues
- Motion without reduced-motion support
- Focus management problems

Files to check: all components, CSS/styles, interactive elements

### 5. Data Ethics Review
Scan for:
- Consent mechanisms (or lack thereof)
- Data collection transparency
- Privacy control accessibility
- Deletion capability

Files to check: forms, analytics, tracking, auth, settings

### 6. Pacing & Breathing
Scan for:
- Opportunities for intentional pauses
- High-stress moments needing breathing space
- Session length without breaks
- Decision points needing reflection time

## Output Format

Produce a structured report with:
1. Executive Summary (3-5 key findings)
2. Critical Issues (must fix)
3. High Priority Opportunities
4. Medium Priority Enhancements
5. Low Priority Nice-to-Haves
6. Implementation Roadmap

For each finding include:
- File path and line number
- Current code/pattern
- Recommended healing integration
- Effort estimate (low/medium/high)
- Sample implementation code
```

### Quick Scan Prompt

```markdown
# Quick Healing Scan

Perform a rapid assessment of this codebase for the top 5 healing opportunities.

Focus on:
1. The harshest error message you can find
2. The most abrupt user action (no confirmation)
3. The biggest accessibility gap
4. The coldest success/failure state
5. The most obvious missing breathing space

For each, provide:
- Location (file:line)
- Current state
- 3-line fix suggestion
```

### Component-Specific Prompt

```markdown
# Component Healing Analysis

Analyze this specific component for healing opportunities:

[PASTE COMPONENT CODE]

Evaluate:
1. Error states - Are they supportive?
2. Loading states - Do they reduce anxiety?
3. Empty states - Are they encouraging?
4. Interactions - Are they mindful?
5. Accessibility - Is it inclusive?
6. Feedback - Does it acknowledge the user?

Provide specific code changes to add healing properties.
```

## Analysis Patterns

### Error Message Scanner

```typescript
// Pattern to identify harsh error messages
const harshPatterns = [
  /error:\s/i,
  /failed/i,
  /invalid/i,
  /wrong/i,
  /incorrect/i,
  /denied/i,
  /rejected/i,
  /unauthorized/i,
  /forbidden/i,
];

const healingAlternatives = {
  'Error:': "We encountered an issue:",
  'Failed': "We couldn't complete",
  'Invalid': "Please check",
  'Wrong': "That doesn't match",
  'Incorrect': "Let's try again",
  'Denied': "Access isn't available",
  'Rejected': "We couldn't process",
  'Unauthorized': "Please sign in",
  'Forbidden': "This area is restricted",
};
```

### Accessibility Gap Detector

```typescript
// Patterns indicating accessibility issues
const a11yPatterns = {
  // Missing labels
  missingLabel: /<(input|button|select)[^>]*(?!aria-label)(?!aria-labelledby)[^>]*>/,

  // Click handlers without keyboard
  clickWithoutKeyboard: /onClick=[^}]*(?!onKeyDown|onKeyPress)/,

  // Images without alt
  imgWithoutAlt: /<img[^>]*(?!alt=)[^>]*>/,

  // Div/span as button
  divAsButton: /<(div|span)[^>]*onClick/,
};
```

### Stress Point Identifier

```typescript
// High-stress interaction patterns
const stressPoints = [
  // Irreversible actions without confirmation
  { pattern: /delete|remove|destroy|clear/i, context: 'onClick' },

  // Large data operations
  { pattern: /submit|send|post|publish/i, context: 'form' },

  // Financial transactions
  { pattern: /pay|purchase|buy|checkout/i, context: 'button' },

  // Account actions
  { pattern: /deactivate|cancel|close.*account/i, context: 'action' },
];
```

## Example Analysis Output

### Sample Finding: Harsh Delete Confirmation

```markdown
## Finding: Harsh Account Deletion Flow

**Severity:** Critical
**Category:** Error Handling + Pacing
**Location:** `src/pages/Settings/DeleteAccount.tsx:45`
**Effort:** Medium

### Current State

```tsx
<button onClick={() => deleteAccount()}>
  Delete Account
</button>

// In deleteAccount():
if (!confirm("Delete your account? This cannot be undone.")) return;
```

### Issue

- No breathing space before irreversible action
- Browser confirm() is cold and jarring
- No acknowledgment of what will be lost
- No suggestion to export data first

### Recommendation

Replace with MindfulTransition + data export prompt + phased confirmation.

### Suggested Implementation

```tsx
function DeleteAccountFlow() {
  const [stage, setStage] = useState<'initial' | 'export' | 'breathe' | 'confirm'>('initial');

  if (stage === 'export') {
    return (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <h3>Before you go...</h3>
        <p>Would you like to download your data first?</p>
        <button onClick={exportData}>Download My Data</button>
        <button onClick={() => setStage('breathe')}>Skip</button>
      </div>
    );
  }

  if (stage === 'breathe') {
    return (
      <BreathePause
        duration={5}
        message="You're about to delete your account"
        subtext="Take a moment to be certain. This cannot be undone."
        onComplete={() => setStage('confirm')}
        onCancel={() => setStage('initial')}
      />
    );
  }

  if (stage === 'confirm') {
    return (
      <SafetyConsent
        title="Final Confirmation"
        body="Deleting your account will permanently remove all your data,
              including [list what they lose]. We're sad to see you go."
        checkboxLabel="I understand this is permanent and want to proceed"
        confirmLabel="Yes, Delete My Account"
        onConfirm={deleteAccount}
        onCancel={() => setStage('initial')}
      />
    );
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setStage('export')}>
      Delete Account...
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Impact

- User Experience: Transforms cold deletion into caring farewell
- Accessibility: Proper dialog semantics, keyboard support
- Emotional Safety: Breathing space prevents regret
```
