# WHM Breathwork Example

A complete example demonstrating the Wim Hof Method breathwork skill lifecycle with safety-first design.

## What This Example Shows

1. **Research** - Clinical evidence (Kox 2014, Muzik 2018) and Tummo tradition context
2. **Protocol Design** - 3-round breathing session with safety briefing
3. **Safety Review** - Physiological safety checks, no competitive framing
4. **Final Output** - Ready-to-use breathing protocol

## The Skill

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | `whm-morning-session` |
| **Purpose** | Beginner 3-round WHM breathing session |
| **Traditions** | Tummo (Tibetan inner heat), Pranayama |
| **Evidence** | Moderate (Kox et al. 2014, Muzik et al. 2018) |

---

## Step 1: Research

### Clinical Evidence

```
Evidence Level: Moderate (for immune modulation)

Key Studies:
- Kox et al. (2014, PNAS, n=24): Trained WHM practitioners showed
  voluntary sympathetic nervous system activation and attenuated
  innate immune response
- Muzik et al. (2018, NeuroImage): Identified periaqueductal gray
  activation during WHM practice

Physiological Mechanisms:
- Controlled hyperventilation → respiratory alkalosis
- Breath retention → hypoxic stress response
- Sympathetic nervous system activation

Safety Profile:
- Syncope risk during retention (practice seated/lying)
- Drowning risk near water (CRITICAL)
- Contraindicated: cardiovascular conditions, epilepsy, pregnancy
```

### Tradition Context

```
Tummo (Tibetan Inner Heat):
- Origin: Six Yogas of Naropa
- Both WHM and Tummo use forceful breathing + retention
- WHM is NOT Tummo — it's a distinct modern methodology
- We honor Tummo as the historical root without conflating

Pranayama parallels:
- Kumbhaka (breath retention) in classical yoga
- Bhastrika (bellows breath) for energizing
```

## Step 2: Protocol Design

The protocol follows a safety-first structure:

### Safety Briefing (FIRST, before any instruction)

> **NEVER** practice in or near water
> **NEVER** while driving or operating machinery
> **NEVER** while standing

### Three-Round Session Structure

| Phase | Description | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Settling | Natural breaths, set intention | 2 min |
| Round 1 | 30 power breaths → retention → recovery | 4-5 min |
| Round 2 | 30 power breaths → retention → recovery | 4-5 min |
| Round 3 | 30 power breaths → retention → recovery | 4-5 min |
| Closing | Normal breathing, gradual return | 2 min |

**Key design decisions:**
- Retention has NO target times (self-regulated by gasp reflex)
- Timer counts UP (elapsed time), never countdown
- "Competitive holding" framing explicitly prevented
- All expected sensations normalized (tingling, lightheadedness)

---

## Step 3: Safety Review

### Review Results: **APPROVED**

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Physiological Safety | Pass |
| Ethics | Pass |
| Clinical Accuracy | Pass |
| Cultural Attribution | Pass |

**Key checks passed:**
- Water/driving/standing warnings prominent
- No retention target times
- Contraindications listed
- "NOT medical treatment" stated
- Tummo acknowledged but not conflated
- Evidence language appropriate ("suggests", "may")

---

## Step 4: Final Output

The breathing protocol is ready for use in:
- Web applications (with breathwork timer component)
- Mobile apps
- Audio recordings (with timing JSON)
- Printed practice cards

---

## What We Demonstrated

### Safety-First Design
- Safety briefing BEFORE any instruction
- Three critical warnings prominently placed
- No competitive framing
- Clear stop criteria

### Evidence Grounding
- Specific studies with sample sizes
- Limitations acknowledged
- Appropriate evidence language

### Cultural Respect
- Tummo as historical root, not conflated
- Pranayama parallels noted
- Clear attribution throughout

/whm-breathwork "morning session" --level beginner
/whm-breathwork "deep practice" --level advanced --rounds 4
/whm-journey --duration 2-week --experience none
