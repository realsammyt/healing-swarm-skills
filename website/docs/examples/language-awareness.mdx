# Language Awareness Example

A complete example demonstrating the language awareness skill lifecycle with psychological safety architecture.

## What This Example Shows

1. **Research** - Deautomatization evidence (Deikman 1966) and cross-tradition parallels
2. **Protocol Design** - 5-minute label delay practice with Pocket Exit grounding
3. **Safety Review** - Psychological safety and grounding adequacy checks
4. **Final Output** - Ready-to-use observation practice

## The Skill

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | `label-delay-practice` |
| **Purpose** | 5-minute beginner observation practice |
| **Level** | Observation (Level 1) |
| **Traditions** | Zen (shikantaza), Phenomenology (epoché), Vipassana |
| **Evidence** | Moderate (Deikman 1966, semantic satiation research) |

---

## Step 1: Research

### Deautomatization Evidence

```
Evidence Level: Moderate (for underlying principles)

Foundational Research:
- Deikman (1966): Coined "deautomatization" — undoing automatic
  perceptual patterns through sustained attention
- Jakobovits & Lambert (1962): Semantic satiation — repeated word
  exposure reduces perceived meaning (well-replicated)
- Lutz et al. (2004): Long-term meditators show enhanced gamma
  synchrony, suggesting altered perceptual processing

Key Insight:
Language automatically categorizes experience before we're aware
of it. The naming process is so fast that we perceive the label,
not the raw sensation. Deautomatization practices slow this process
enough to notice the gap.

Limitations:
- Direct research on label delay exercises is limited
- Most evidence from broader mindfulness research
- Individual variation is large
```

### Tradition Parallels

```
Zen: Shikantaza (just sitting) — non-conceptual awareness
Phenomenology: Husserl's epoché — bracketing assumptions
Dzogchen: Rigpa — awareness prior to conceptual overlay
Vipassana: Noting practice — bare attention
Chase Hughes: Tongue (2024) — modern behavioral framing

Attribution: Shared principles across traditions.
We honor each tradition's distinct context.

## Step 2: Protocol Design

The protocol follows a psychological safety-first structure:

### Safety Architecture

**Before any practice:**
- Contraindication screening (psychosis, dissociation, depersonalization)
- Pocket Exit grounding anchor taught FIRST

**Pocket Exit (5-step grounding):**
1. Tongue tip to roof of mouth
2. Left thumb to sternum, press lightly
3. Breathe: in for 4, out for 6
4. Look at nearest object — name it deliberately
5. Say one useful number aloud

### Practice Structure

| Phase | Duration | Activity |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Settling | 1 min | Run Pocket Exit, set intention |
| Label Delay | 3 min | Look at 5 objects without naming |
| Return | 1 min | Full Pocket Exit, deliberate naming |

**Key design decisions:**
- Only 5 minutes for Level 1 (appropriate for beginners)
- Ordinary objects (nothing special required)
- "Nothing happened" explicitly listed as valid experience
- "Wait until naming feels normal" before standing

---

## Step 3: Safety Review

### Review Results: **APPROVED**

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Psychological Safety | Pass |
| Grounding Adequacy | Pass |
| Ethics | Pass |
| Evidence Claims | Pass |
| Cultural Attribution | Pass |

**Key checks passed:**
- Contraindications listed (psychosis, dissociation, depersonalization)
- Pocket Exit taught before practice begins
- Exit permission at every phase
- "Nothing happened" normalized
- No mystification or hyperbolic framing
- Language framed as tool, not pathology
- "Wait until language feels normal" present
- Cross-tradition attribution complete
- "Contemplative exploration" framing (not therapy)

---

## Step 4: Final Output

The practice protocol is ready for use:
- As individual self-guided practice
- In guided group settings (with consent framework)
- Adapted for audio recording
- As Week 1 of an 8-week progressive curriculum

---

## What We Demonstrated

### Psychological Safety First
- Contraindication screening before any practice
- Grounding anchor taught BEFORE the practice
- Exit permission at every phase
- Full return to ordinary awareness
- "Wait until language feels normal" instruction

### Evidence Honesty
- "Contemplative exploration, not therapy"
- "Direct research limited" acknowledged
- Foundational citations with dates
- No promises of specific experiences

### Gentle Progression
- Level 1 is only 5 minutes
- "Names arrive faster than expected" IS the insight
- "Nothing happened" is explicitly valid
- The ordinary is the laboratory

## Try It Yourself

```bash
/language-awareness "first practice" --level observation
/language-awareness "create gaps in naming" --level interruption
/group-perception --exercise collective-label-delay --participants 6
```

*"The goal is not to destroy language but to hear the world without translating it first."*
