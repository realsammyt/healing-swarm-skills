# Healing Research Example

A complete example demonstrating the research skill lifecycle coordinating three specialized agents for a comprehensive research brief on acupressure for hand ligament healing.

## The Research Query

```bash
/healing-research "acupressure for hand ligament healing" --depth comprehensive
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Topic** | Acupressure for hand ligament healing |
| **Depth** | Comprehensive |
| **Traditions** | Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) |
| **Evidence** | Moderate (pain) / Limited (ligament-specific) |

## Multi-Agent Research Process

Three agents work in parallel:

| Agent | Role | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| Traditions Scholar | TCM meridians, acupoints, classical texts | `traditions-research.md` |
| Clinical Researcher | Systematic reviews, RCTs, safety data | `clinical-evidence.md` |
| Mechanisms Neuroscientist | Fascial planes, mechanotransduction | `mechanism-bridges.md` |

## Key Findings

### TCM Framework
- Six meridians traverse the hand and wrist
- LI-4 (Hegu), LI-5 (Yangxi), SJ-5 (Waiguan) identified as primary points
- WHO Standard Acupuncture Point Locations (2008) used for specificity

### Clinical Evidence
- **Pain relief**: Moderate evidence from systematic reviews
- **Blood flow**: Pressure on acupoints increases local circulation
- **Ligament healing**: No direct RCT evidence; theoretical support only
- **Safety**: Generally safe when applied gently to non-acute injuries

### Mechanism Bridges
- 80% correspondence between meridians and fascial planes (Langevin & Yandow, 2002)
- Mechanotransduction explains pressure → cellular signaling
- TCM and science presented as complementary maps, not identical

## Evidence Language Calibration

| Claim | Level | Language |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Pain relief | Moderate | "Research suggests" |
| Blood flow increase | Moderate | "Studies show" |
| Ligament healing | Limited | "May theoretically support" |
| Meridian-anatomy mapping | Emerging | "Some evidence suggests" |

## Safety Review: Passed

- Evidence language calibrated to evidence level
- TCM properly attributed with era and source texts
- No cure claims
- "Complement to medical care" framing
- Gentle pressure guidance (pain = stop)

## Try It

```bash
/healing-research "acupressure for hand healing" --depth comprehensive
/traditions-research "TCM meridian theory for upper extremity"
/clinical-research "acupressure pain relief systematic review"
/mechanism-mapping "qi cultivation" --to neuroscience
```
