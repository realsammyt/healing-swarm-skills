# Group Perception Example

A complete example demonstrating the group perception skill lifecycle with consent framework, facilitation guide, and structured debrief.

## The Exercise

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | `collective-label-delay` |
| **Purpose** | Team workshop exploring perception and language |
| **Participants** | 8 people |
| **Duration** | 10 min exercise + 10 min debrief |
| **Facilitator** | Required (not participating) |

## Three Phases

| Phase | Duration | Activity |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Name Storm | 2 min | Rapid-fire naming of shared object |
| Silence | 3 min | Look at object without speaking |
| Texture Report | 5 min | Describe using only sensations (no name) |

## Consent Framework

Every group exercise begins with a read-aloud consent script:
- Clear description of what will happen
- Right to withdraw without explanation
- No pressure to share inner experience
- Explicit verbal consent from each participant
- Observation-only option for anyone who declines

## Facilitator Requirements

- Facilitator does NOT participate (can't hold space and go deep)
- Grounding protocol ready (Pocket Exit)
- Quiet step-out space available
- Troubleshooting guide for common situations
- No pressure for "breakthrough" narratives

## Debrief Design

- Sharing optional — no one required to speak
- "What did you notice?" not "What did you feel?"
- No interpreting others' experiences
- Graceful close after natural pause

## Safety Review: Passed

- Full consent framework with explicit verbal agreement
- Facilitator not participating
- Distress response protocol ready
- No-share option explicitly stated
- Power dynamic awareness included

## Try It

```bash
/group-perception --exercise collective-label-delay --participants 8 --context "team workshop"
/group-perception --exercise pronoun-relay --context "retreat"
/group-perception --exercise silence-sit --context "meditation group"
```
