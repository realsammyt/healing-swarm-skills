# Cold Exposure Example

A complete example demonstrating the WHM cold exposure skill lifecycle with progressive levels and safety architecture.

## The Skill

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | `cold-finish-introduction` |
| **Purpose** | First cold exposure experience |
| **Level** | 1 — Cold Finish (gentlest entry) |
| **Evidence** | Moderate (cold adaptation studies) |

## Progressive Levels

| Level | Practice | Duration | Partner |
|-------|----------|----------|---------|
| 1. Cold Finish | End warm shower with cold | 15-30 sec | Recommended |
| 2. Extended Cold | Longer cold segments | 1-3 min | Recommended |
| 3. Cold First | Start shower cold | 2-5 min | Recommended |
| 4. Cold Immersion | Ice bath / cold water | 2-10 min | **MANDATORY** |

## Protocol Highlights

- **Safety check first**: Cardiovascular screening before any cold exposure
- **Head never submerged**: Explicit prohibition in every protocol
- **No WHM breathing before cold**: Hypocapnia + water = drowning risk
- **"No shame in stepping out early"**: Non-competitive framing throughout
- **Natural rewarming**: No hot shower immediately after (afterdrop risk)

## Temperature Reference

| Level | Temperature |
|-------|------------|
| Cool | 20-15°C (68-59°F) |
| Cold | 15-10°C (59-50°F) |
| Very Cold | 10-5°C (50-41°F) |
| Ice | Below 5°C (41°F) |

## Safety Review: Passed

- Cardiovascular conditions listed as first contraindication
- Head submersion prohibited
- Breathing-cold separation enforced
- Progressive approach (15-30 sec start)
- No toxic toughness or competitive framing
- Afterdrop awareness and rewarming guidance

## Try It

```bash
/whm-cold-exposure --level 1-cold-finish
/whm-cold-exposure --level 2-extended-cold
/whm-journey --duration 2-week --experience none
```
