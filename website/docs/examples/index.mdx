## What We Demonstrate

### Complete Skill Lifecycle

```
Research > Content > Quality > Deployment
   |          |         |          |
Background  Draft    Review     Ready
gathered   created  passed     to use
```

### Ethics-First Approach

- Started with safety considerations
- Included disclaimers from the beginning
- Built grounding techniques into content
- Never made promises we couldn't keep

### Evidence Grounding

- Matched language to evidence level
- Acknowledged limitations
- Cited traceable sources
- Distinguished traditional from clinical

### Cultural Respect

- Named tradition specifically
- Provided historical context
- Noted adaptations made
- Preserved meaning while adapting form

## Try It Yourself

### 1. Create Your Own Skill

Use the simple meditation example as a template:

```bash
mkdir my-healing-skill
cp -r examples/simple-meditation/* my-healing-skill/
```

### 2. Modify for Your Focus

- Research your tradition and evidence
- Write content following templates
- Run through quality review
- Iterate until approved

### 3. Use the Full Swarm

```bash
# Research
/healing-research "your healing topic"

# Content
/healing-content --type visualization --topic "your topic"

# Review
/healing-review ./your-content.md

# Or full lifecycle
/healing-swarm "Your Project" --focus "your healing area"
```
