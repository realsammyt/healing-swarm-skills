# Coherence Meditation Example

A complete example demonstrating the consciousness skills lifecycle for Grinberg-based interhemispheric coherence meditation.

## The Skill

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | `morning-coherence` |
| **Purpose** | 20-minute beginner coherence meditation |
| **Tradition** | Grinberg's self-allusive meditation (UNAM, 1970s-1994) |
| **Evidence** | Preliminary (small sample EEG studies) |

## 6-Phase Structure

Based on Grinberg's self-allusive meditation. Each phase **adds** to previous awareness:

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 1. Settling | 2-3 min | Ground initial awareness |
| 2. Body | 4-5 min | Physical sensations |
| 3. Emotion | 4-5 min | Emotional field (keeping body) |
| 4. Thought | 4-5 min | Mental patterns (keeping body + emotion) |
| 5. Unified | 3-4 min | All domains simultaneously ("high-inclusion") |
| 6. Integration | 2-3 min | Grounding, return |

## Research Basis

> **Evidence level: Preliminary**
>
> Grinberg's EEG studies at UNAM suggest self-allusive meditation may enhance
> interhemispheric coherence (alpha and theta synchronization). Small sample
> sizes, limited replication. Broader meditation neuroscience provides moderate
> support for meditation-related EEG changes.

## Safety Review: Passed

- Evidence honestly labeled as "Preliminary"
- "Suggests" language throughout (never "proves")
- Disorientation guidance present
- Overwhelm addressed ("return to body awareness")
- No target experiences promised
- Mental health disclaimer present

## Try It

```bash
/coherence-meditation "morning coherence" --level beginner
/coherence-meditation "healing support" --level advanced --duration 30
```
