## Vision

To democratize access to holistic healing wisdom by synthesizing rigorously validated ancient practices with modern clinical evidence, delivered through beautiful, intuitive digital experiences that empower individuals to actively participate in their healing journey.

## Why This Exists

This repository is more than a collection of AI skills—it's an invitation to participate in something larger than any one of us.

### For Individuals

We believe that **everyone deserves access to healing wisdom**. Not just those who can afford expensive programs. Not just those lucky enough to live near great teachers. Everyone.

This framework helps you:
- **Learn and grow** by exploring healing traditions with proper guidance
- **Build tools** that support your own healing journey
- **Share what works** with others who might benefit

### For Communities

Healing doesn't happen in isolation. We heal **with** each other—in families, in neighborhoods, in communities of practice. This repository provides a foundation for:
- **Local healing circles** to create resources tailored to their traditions
- **Practitioners** to build ethical digital tools for their communities
- **Cultural groups** to document and share their healing wisdom on their own terms

### For the World

The challenges we face—stress, anxiety, chronic illness, disconnection—are global. The solutions must be too. But global doesn't mean homogeneous. It means:
- **Many traditions** contributing their unique wisdom
- **Many perspectives** enriching the collective understanding
- **Many builders** creating tools for their specific contexts

## A Framework to Enhance

**This is a starting point, not a finished product.**

The skills, templates, and documentation here represent one way of doing things. They work. They're tested. But they're not complete—and they never will be, because healing knowledge keeps growing.

### What You Bring Matters

You have insights this framework doesn't have:
- **Your tradition** may have practices not yet documented here
- **Your community** may have needs we haven't anticipated
- **Your experience** may reveal gaps we couldn't see

### The Invitation

We're not asking you to follow a prescription. We're inviting you to:

1. **Take what's useful** from this framework
2. **Adapt it** to your context and community
3. **Contribute back** what you learn
4. **Help others** do the same

This is how healing wisdom has always spread—from person to person, community to community, generation to generation. We're just using new tools to continue an ancient practice.

## Two Ways to Use This Framework

### Build New Healing Applications

Create healing-first projects from the ground up using our 7 swarm skills: Research, Design, Content, Build, Review, Deploy, and Swarm Coordination.

### Upgrade Existing Projects

Use [Project Analysis](/docs/integration/project-analysis) to scan any codebase and add healing properties:

- **The HEAL Assessment** identifies: **H**arsh interactions, **E**motional blind spots, **A**ccessibility gaps, **L**ost opportunities
- Works on apps, websites, games, interactive narratives
- Prioritized recommendations with implementation guides

## What You Can Build

| Project Type | Patterns Available |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Web & Mobile Apps** | Gentle errors, breathing spaces, ethical data, accessibility |
| **Video Games** | Adaptive difficulty, restorative spaces, breathing mechanics |
| **Interactive Stories** | Content warnings, safe spaces, emotional pacing |
| **Any Digital Experience** | Healing gamification, mindful interactions, UI wellness |

*"The capacity for healing is intrinsic to consciousness. We build tools that support what life already knows how to do. And we build them together—because that's how healing has always worked."*
