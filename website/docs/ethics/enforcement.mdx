# Ethics Enforcement

Ethics is not aspirational—it's enforced through multiple layers of checks, gates, and agent oversight.

---

## Three-Layer Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         LAYER 3: ETHICS GUARDIAN             │
│         (Final review, blocking power)       │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         LAYER 2: REQUIRED ELEMENTS           │
│         (Disclaimers, attributions, etc.)    │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         LAYER 1: FOUNDATIONAL GUARDRAILS     │
│         (Absolute constraints, all agents)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

  log: violation-report
```

---

## Layer 2: Required Elements

Every piece of healing content **MUST** include these elements.

### Medical Disclaimers

**Required text variations:**

**Standard disclaimer:**
> "This content is for informational purposes only and does not replace professional medical care. Consult your healthcare provider before beginning any new healing practice."

**Specific condition disclaimer:**
> "If you have [condition], consult your healthcare provider before practicing. This is not medical advice."

**Emergency disclaimer:**
> "If you experience [symptoms], seek immediate medical attention. Do not delay care."

**Placement:**
- At start of content
- Before practice instructions
- At end of content

### Psychological Safety Elements

**Grounding techniques:**

For intensive practices:
```markdown
## If You Need to Stop

If you feel uncomfortable:
1. Open your eyes
2. Notice 5 things you can see
3. Take 3 slow breaths
4. Return when ready

You can stop anytime.
```

**Crisis resources:**

For mental health content:
```markdown
## If You Need Support

If you're in crisis:
- Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
- Text "HELLO" to 741741 (Crisis Text Line)
- Go to your nearest emergency room

These practices support but don't replace professional care.
```

### Cultural Attribution

**Required structure:**

```markdown
## Background

**Tradition:** [Specific tradition name]
**Origin:** [Geographic location and era]
**Source:** [Primary text or lineage]
**Adaptation:** [Any changes from traditional form]

This practice draws on [tradition] as documented in [source].
We honor the lineage holders who preserved this wisdom.
```

### Evidence Honesty

**Required structure:**

```markdown
## Evidence

**Evidence Level:** [Strong/Moderate/Preliminary/Traditional]

**Research Findings:**
- [Finding 1 with appropriate language]
- [Finding 2 with appropriate language]

**Limitations:**
- [Study limitation 1]
- [Study limitation 2]

**Note:** Results vary. This may help but is not guaranteed.

**Sources:**
- [Citation 1] (PMID: xxxxx)
- [Citation 2] (DOI: xxxxx)
```

### Enforcement

```yaml
layer: required-elements
enforcement: automated-check
stage: pre-deployment
severity: high
on_missing:
  action: block-deployment
  notify: content-creator
  require: add-elements
  re-review: mandatory
```

---

## Layer 3: Ethics Guardian

The ethics-guardian agent has special authority over all content.

### Special Powers

**Blocking Authority:**
- Can block deployment immediately
- Cannot be overridden
- Final word on ethics
- No bypass allowed

**Review Authority:**
- Reviews all content before deployment
- Can require modifications
- Can escalate to human review
- Maintains ethics audit log

**Decision Authority:**
- Final word on ethics questions
- Interprets guardrails
- Resolves edge cases
- Updates standards

### Review Process

```yaml
ethics-guardian-review:
  trigger: pre-deployment

  checks:
    medical_safety:
      - no_diagnosis
      - no_medication_advice
      - no_cure_claims
      - disclaimers_present

    psychological_safety:
      - no_shame_blame
      - grounding_techniques_present
      - permission_to_stop
      - crisis_resources (if mental health)

    cultural_integrity:
      - traditions_named
      - attributions_complete
      - no_closed_practices
      - context_preserved

    data_privacy:
      - no_external_transmission
      - user_controls_data
      - privacy_policy_clear

  decision:
    if_all_pass: approve
    if_any_critical: block
    if_any_high: conditional-approval
    if_uncertain: escalate-human
```

### Approval Statuses

**APPROVED:**
- All checks pass
- Ready for deployment
- Logged as approved

**CONDITIONAL:**
- Most checks pass
- Minor issues noted
- Deploy with fixes

**BLOCKED:**
- Critical issue found
- Cannot deploy
- Must fix and re-review

**ESCALATED:**
- Uncertain case
- Requires human judgment
- Deployment paused

### Enforcement

```yaml
layer: ethics-guardian
agent: ethics-guardian
authority: absolute
enforcement: manual-review
frequency: pre-deployment
severity: critical-to-low

on_block:
  action: prevent-deployment
  notify: all-agents
  require: complete-fix
  re-review: mandatory

on_conditional:
  action: allow-with-conditions
  notify: content-creator
  track: fix-deadline

on_escalate:
  action: pause-deployment
  notify: human-reviewer
  wait: human-decision
```

## Harm Assessment Matrix

Evaluate potential harm before proceeding:

```
                Low Probability    High Probability
High Severity   CAUTION            BLOCK
Low Severity    PROCEED            CAUTION
```

### Assessment Questions

**Physical Harm:**
- Could this cause physical injury?
- Could this delay necessary medical care?
- Are contraindications documented?
- **If yes to any → HIGH severity**

**Psychological Harm:**
- Could this cause emotional distress?
- Could this exacerbate mental health conditions?
- Are grounding techniques provided?
- **If yes without safeguards → HIGH severity**

**Cultural Harm:**
- Could this harm source communities?
- Is attribution complete and respectful?
- Are closed practices protected?
- **If yes to harm → HIGH severity**

**Privacy Harm:**
- Could this expose sensitive user data?
- Is consent explicit?
- Is data minimized?
- **If yes to exposure → HIGH severity**

---

## Automated Checks

Some ethics enforcement is automated:

### Pre-Processing Checks

```bash
# Before any agent starts
check_ethics_loaded() {
  if ! agent.has_loaded("ethics-guardrails.md"); then
    BLOCK "Ethics guardrails not loaded"
  fi
}
```

### During-Processing Checks

```bash
# Continuous monitoring
monitor_content() {
  if contains("will cure"); then
    BLOCK "Cure claim detected"
  fi

  if contains("you must"); then
    WARN "Coercive language detected"
  fi

  if !contains("disclaimer"); then
    WARN "Medical disclaimer missing"
  fi
}
```

### Post-Processing Checks

```bash
# Before deployment
validate_output() {
  checks = [
    has_medical_disclaimer(),
    has_proper_attribution(),
    no_cure_claims(),
    no_closed_practices(),
    grounding_present() if intensive(),
  ]

  if any(check == FAIL for check in checks):
    BLOCK "Required element missing"
  fi
}
```

---

## Human Escalation

When automated checks are insufficient:

### Escalation Triggers

Escalate to human review when:
- Edge case not covered by guidelines
- Conflicting principles
- Cultural sensitivity question
- Novel practice type
- Community concern raised

### Escalation Process

```yaml
escalation:
  1_detect:
    trigger: automated-check-uncertain
    capture: context + content + question

  2_notify:
    recipients:
      - ethics-guardian-lead
      - relevant-specialist
      - community-liaison (if cultural)
    urgency: based-on-severity

  3_review:
    participants: 2+ humans
    process: discussion + decision
    timeline: 24h (critical) / 1wk (normal)

  4_decide:
    options: [approve, block, modify, defer]
    documentation: rationale-required
    communication: notify-all-stakeholders

  5_update:
    guidelines: if-new-pattern
    training: if-repeat-issue
    audit: log-decision
```

---

## Continuous Monitoring

Ethics enforcement doesn't stop at deployment:

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

```yaml
monitoring:
  frequency: continuous

  checks:
    - content_accuracy
    - attribution_integrity
    - links_working
    - disclaimers_present

  alerts:
    critical: immediate
    high: daily-digest
    medium: weekly-report
```

### Feedback Integration

```yaml
feedback:
  sources:
    - user-reports
    - practitioner-feedback
    - community-input
    - incident-reports

  process:
    1_receive: log + acknowledge
    2_investigate: review-content
    3_assess: harm-potential
    4_respond: fix | update | clarify
    5_communicate: notify-reporter
```

---

## Audit Trail

All ethics decisions are logged:

```yaml
audit_entry:
  timestamp: ISO-8601
  content_id: unique-identifier
  agent: agent-name
  check: check-name
  result: pass | fail | conditional
  severity: critical | high | medium | low
  action: block | approve | conditional
  rationale: text-explanation
  escalated: true | false
  human_reviewer: name (if escalated)
```

**Retention:** Permanent
**Access:** Ethics team only
**Purpose:** Learning, accountability, improvement

*"Ethics enforcement is not optional. It's built into every layer. It cannot be bypassed. It protects users absolutely."*
