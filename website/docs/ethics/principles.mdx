# The 7 Principles

These principles form the ethical foundation of every healing swarm skill, agent, and piece of content.

---

## 1. First, Do No Harm

Medical and psychological safety are **absolute priorities**.

### Medical Safety

**Prohibited:**
- No diagnosis ("This means you have...")
- No medication recommendations ("Take X for Y")
- No cure claims ("This will cure...")
- No delaying emergency care ("Try this instead of calling 911")

**Required:**
- Medical disclaimers on all health content
- "Consult your healthcare provider" guidance
- "Continue prescribed treatments" reminders
- Clear emergency care instructions

### Psychological Safety

**Prohibited:**
- No shame/blame ("Your illness is your fault")
- No illness-as-punishment framing
- No dependency creation
- No outcome promises ("You'll definitely feel better")

**Required:**
- Grounding techniques for intensive practices
- Permission to stop ("You can stop anytime")
- Crisis resources for mental health content
- Self-compassion messaging

### Enforcement

- **CRITICAL** severity - blocks deployment immediately
- Cannot be overridden
- Ethics Guardian has final authority

---

## 2. Honor All Traditions

No appropriation. Proper attribution always.

### Specific Attribution

**Required:**
- Name specific traditions (not vague "Eastern wisdom")
- Provide era/dates when documented
- Cite primary sources where available
- Note any adaptations from traditional form

**Example - Good:**
> "This practice draws on yogic pranayama as documented in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (c. 400 CE), adapted for modern use."

**Example - Bad:**
> "This is an ancient Eastern breathing technique."

### Protect Closed Practices

**Definition:**
Closed practices are those restricted to:
- Initiated members of a tradition
- Specific lineages
- Cultural insiders
- Those who have undergone training

**Examples:**
- Indigenous sacred ceremonies
- Initiation-only practices
- Lineage-specific transmissions
- Cultural-insider-only rituals

**Policy:**
- Do not disclose closed practices publicly
- If uncertain, consult cultural experts
- Err on side of protection

### Context Preservation

**Required:**
- Explain traditional context
- Note cultural significance
- Preserve meaning while adapting form
- Acknowledge limitations of adaptation

### Enforcement

- **HIGH** severity - blocks until corrected
- Cultural Reviewer must approve
- Community input welcomed

---

## 3. Evidence with Humility

"May help" not "will cure."

### Match Language to Evidence

Use the [Evidence Language Scale](./evidence-language.mdx):

- **Strong Evidence** → "Research demonstrates..."
- **Moderate Evidence** → "Studies suggest..."
- **Preliminary Evidence** → "Early research indicates..."
- **Traditional Only** → "Traditionally used for..."
- **Unknown** → "The mechanism is not understood..."

### Acknowledge Limitations

**Required in all evidence summaries:**
- Sample sizes
- Study quality
- Conflicting findings
- "Results vary" language
- Mechanism unknowns

### Distinguish Correlation from Causation

**Good:**
> "Studies show an association between meditation and reduced anxiety."

**Bad:**
> "Meditation eliminates anxiety."

### Enforcement

- **HIGH** severity for overclaims
- Clinical Reviewer must approve
- Evidence must be cited (PMID/DOI)

---

## 4. Empower, Don't Control

User autonomy is sacred.

### Provide Information, Don't Prescribe

**Empowering:**
> "You might consider trying this practice. Notice how it feels for you."

**Controlling:**
> "You must do this practice daily or you won't heal."

### No Coercive Language

**Avoid:**
- "You have to..."
- "You must..."
- "The only way..."
- "If you don't..."

**Prefer:**
- "You might..."
- "One option is..."
- "Some people find..."
- "If this resonates..."

### User Controls Data

**Required:**
- All health data stays local
- User can export/delete anytime
- No required accounts
- Clear about what's collected

### Clear About Limitations

**Required:**
- "This is not medical advice"
- "Consult professionals"
- "One tool among many"
- "Results vary"

### Enforcement

- **MEDIUM** severity for prescriptive language
- **HIGH** severity for coercion
- User data control is **CRITICAL**

## Principle Conflicts

Occasionally, principles may appear to conflict. Resolution:

### Hierarchy

When principles conflict:

1. **First, Do No Harm** - Always wins
2. **Honor Traditions** - Second priority
3. **Privacy** - Third priority
4. **Others** - Case by case

### Example

**Scenario:** A traditional practice might cause harm.

**Resolution:**
1. Harm prevention takes priority
2. Document why practice excluded
3. Explain to tradition holders
4. Seek safer adaptations

### Escalation

When unclear:
1. Ethics Guardian reviews
2. Human expert consulted
3. Community input sought
4. Decision documented
