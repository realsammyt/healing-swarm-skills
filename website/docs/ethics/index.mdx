# Ethics Framework

The healing swarm operates under a single guiding principle:

> **"First, do no harm."**

Every component, every agent, every piece of content is built with the understanding that our users may be **vulnerable**—injured, ill, anxious, desperate, or grieving. Our responsibility is sacred.

## The 7 Principles

The complete ethical foundation of the healing swarm.

[View detailed principles →](./principles.mdx)

### Quick Reference

1. **First, Do No Harm** - Medical and psychological safety are absolute priorities
2. **Honor All Traditions** - No appropriation; proper attribution always
3. **Evidence with Humility** - "May help" not "will cure"
4. **Empower, Don't Control** - User autonomy is sacred
5. **Privacy as Sanctuary** - Healing data stays with the healer
6. **Accessible to All** - Design for the most vulnerable users
7. **Continuous Improvement** - Learn from outcomes, update with evidence

## Enforcement Architecture

Ethics is not aspirational—it's enforced through multiple layers.

[View enforcement details →](./enforcement.mdx)

### Three Layers

**Layer 1: Foundational Guardrails**
- Absolute constraints defined in `ethics-guardrails.md`
- No medical diagnosis, no cure claims, no closed practices
- Required by all agents

**Layer 2: Required Elements**
- Medical disclaimers
- Psychological safety features
- Cultural attribution
- Evidence honesty

**Layer 3: Ethics Guardian**
- Special agent with blocking authority
- Final word on ethics questions
- Can escalate to human review

## Evidence Language

How to match language to evidence strength.

### Quick Guide

| Evidence Level | Language |
|----------------|----------|
| **Strong** | "Research demonstrates..." |
| **Moderate** | "Studies suggest..." |
| **Preliminary** | "Early research indicates..." |
| **Traditional** | "Traditionally used for..." |
| **Unknown** | "The mechanism is not understood..." |

## Why Ethics Matter

### Our Users Are Vulnerable

People who seek healing applications are often:
- In physical pain
- Emotionally distressed
- Desperate for solutions
- Willing to try anything
- Susceptible to false promises

This vulnerability creates responsibility. We must not:
- Exploit their desperation
- Make promises we can't keep
- Delay their access to real medical care
- Harm them through negligence

### Healing is Sacred

Across cultures and millennia, healing has been treated as sacred work. The healer accepts responsibility for the well-being of those who come to them.

We inherit this responsibility. Our digital tools carry the same weight as any healing practice. We must be worthy of the trust placed in us.

## Population Considerations

### Always Consider

- Children
- Pregnant people
- Elderly
- People with serious illness
- People with mental health conditions
- People in crisis

### Design Principle

> **"Assume the most vulnerable possible user."**

If content would be inappropriate for any vulnerable population, it needs additional safeguards or should not be included.

---

## Escalation Triggers

Immediately escalate if:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| User reports worsening symptoms | Advise medical consultation, don't troubleshoot |
| Content approaches prohibited territory | Stop and review before proceeding |
| Cultural appropriation concerns | Get guidance on open/closed practices |
| Evidence claims seem exaggerated | Verify before including |
| Vulnerable population considerations | Get explicit approval |
| Any uncertainty about safety | When in doubt, escalate |

---

## Continuous Improvement

Ethics is not static. The framework evolves:

1. **Learn from incidents** - When something goes wrong, update guardrails
2. **Stay current** - Monitor emerging research and best practices
3. **Seek feedback** - From users, practitioners, communities
4. **Regular review** - Annual ethics audit of entire system
