## Content Guidelines

### Required Elements

All healing content MUST include:

1. **Medical disclaimer** - "Does not replace professional care"
2. **Permission to stop** - "You can stop at any time"
3. **Tradition attribution** - When applicable
4. **Evidence language** - Appropriate to strength

### Voice and Tone

**Gentle:**
- Invitational, not commanding
- "You might..." not "You will..."
- Permission-based

**Grounded:**
- Clear, concrete instructions
- No mystical jargon without explanation
- Practical guidance

**Respectful:**
- Honor source traditions
- Acknowledge limitations
- No appropriation

### Safety Considerations

Content must include:

- Contraindications when relevant
- Grounding techniques for intensive practices
- Exit ramps ("If you feel uncomfortable...")
- Crisis resources for mental health content
