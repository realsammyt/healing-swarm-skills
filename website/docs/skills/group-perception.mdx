# group-perception

**Trigger:** `/group-perception`

Group and paired perception exercises with consent frameworks, facilitation guides, and debrief structures. Based on cognitive deautomatization research and contemplative group practice traditions.

## Agents

- **Language Awareness Guide** - Exercise design and facilitation
- **Content Writer** - Script polishing
- **Ethics Guardian** - Consent and safety review

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `exercise` | Yes | Exercise type (see available exercises) |
| `participants` | No | Number of participants |
| `context` | No | Setting (workshop, retreat, classroom) |

## Outputs

- `facilitation-guide.md` - Complete facilitator script
- `consent-framework.md` - Informed consent protocol
- `debrief-questions.md` - Post-exercise discussion guide

## Examples

**Team workshop:**
```bash
/group-perception --exercise collective-label-delay --participants 8 --context "team workshop"
```

**Retreat pairs exercise:**
```bash
/group-perception --exercise conversion-drill --context "retreat"
```

**Classroom meaning exploration:**
```bash
/group-perception --exercise meaning-collapse-circle --participants 12 --context "philosophy class"
```

## Available Exercises

### 1. Collective Label Delay (10 min, 3-12 people)

Circle of participants with a shared object in center.

| Phase | Duration | Activity |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Name Storm | 2 min | Everyone names the object rapidly |
| Silence | 3 min | Look at the object without naming |
| Texture Report | 5 min | Describe using only sensations, never the name |

**Debrief:** "What showed up in the silence that wasn't there during the naming?"

### 2. Pronoun Relay (15 min, 3-6 people)

| Phase | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | Person A tells a story replacing "I" with "the body" |
| 2 | Person B retells it replacing "I" with "the voice" |
| 3 | Person C retells it replacing "I" with "the pattern" |
| 4 | Group discussion: which version felt most honest? |

**Debrief:** "What happens to the story when 'I' is removed?"

### 3. Meaning Collapse Circle (15 min, 3-12 people)

Choose a common phrase everyone knows ("I'm fine", "It is what it is"). Repeat in unison, increasingly slowly, for 3 minutes until it becomes pure sound. 2 minutes of silence. Each person shares one word or image.

**Debrief:** "What was it like when the meaning left?"

### 4. Map-Maker's Interrogation (20 min, 3-8 people)

One person presents a belief. The group asks only:
- "Who drew this map?"
- "What did they leave out?"
- "Where does the map want you NOT to go?"
- "What would change if you burned the map?"

Presenter listens and journals. No defending. 5 minutes silent reflection.

**Debrief:** "What's different about questioning the frame instead of the content?"

### 5. Conversion Drill (15 min, pairs)

Partner A states an abstract emotional complaint. Partner B guides through Anchor + Motion + Tilt to create a physical metaphor. Example: "I'm overwhelmed" becomes "Feels like holding a wet sponge that won't stop getting heavier."

**Debrief:** "What changed when the feeling had a body?"

### 6. Silence Sit (30 min, 2-20 people)

No speaking, reading, devices, or eye contact. Timer-based. At close: one minute of shared eye contact in pairs. Optional debrief: "What did the silence sound like?"

> This is the most challenging group protocol. The deepest claim is that
> silence is not absence but the *parent* of language.

## Consent Framework

**Read aloud before EVERY session:**

> "This exercise involves [description]. You may notice shifts in how you
> perceive language or yourself. This is expected and temporary.
>
> You are not expected to share your inner experience unless you choose to.
> You may stop participating at any time without explanation. There is no
> correct experience — whatever you notice is valid, including noticing nothing.
>
> Does everyone consent to participate?"

- Wait for explicit verbal consent from each participant
- Anyone who does not consent may observe silently or leave without judgment
- Facilitator must NOT also be a participant

## Facilitator Safety Guide

| Issue | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Participant becomes distressed | Step outside together. Run grounding. No pressure to return |
| Group won't stop talking during silence | Gently redirect. If persistent, shorten and debrief |
| No one shares in debrief | Offer one observation yourself. Sit with silence. Close gracefully |
| Someone dominates debrief | "Thank you — let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet" |
| Participant refuses consent | Welcome observation or departure. No shame. Move on |
| Persistent disorientation | Run full grounding. If unresolved in 10 min, suggest mental health professional |

## Quality Gates
