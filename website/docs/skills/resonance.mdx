# resonance-pairing

**Trigger:** `/resonance-pairing`

Paired and group meditation protocols inspired by Grinberg's transferred potential research, with rigorous consent and safety framing.

## Agents

- **Consciousness Researcher** - Transferred potential research and evidence
- **Resonance Facilitator** - Protocol design with consent framework
- **Content Writer** - Participant-facing materials
- **Ethics Guardian** - CRITICAL review for consent, safety, and claims

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `description` | Yes | What kind of paired practice |
| `group` | No | `dyad` (default), `small_group`, `large_group` |
| `level` | No | `first_time`, `experienced`, `advanced` |

## Outputs

- `pairing-protocol.md` - Complete paired practice guide
- `participant-guide.md` - Instructions for each participant
- `consent-framework.md` - Explicit informed consent document
- `boundary-guidelines.md` - Interpersonal safety guidelines
- `facilitator-checklist.md` - Pre/during/post session checklist

## Examples

**First paired session:**
```bash
/resonance-pairing "first session" --group dyad --level first_time
```

**Group meditation circle:**
```bash
/resonance-pairing "group meditation" --group small_group --level experienced
```

**Advanced transferred potential exploration:**
```bash
/resonance-pairing "transferred potential" --group dyad --level advanced
```

## Protocol Structure

Based on Grinberg's transferred potential experimental protocol:

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Individual Preparation | 5 min | Separate coherence practice |
| 2. Connection Establishment | 5-7 min | Shared presence, proximity |
| 3. Shared Meditation | 15-20 min | Synchronized practice |
| 4. Separation (optional) | 5-10 min | Partners in different rooms |
| 5. Reunification & Sharing | 5-10 min | Debrief with permission to share or not |

## Consent Requirements

**All paired practices require:**

- Explicit informed consent from ALL participants before beginning
- Clear explanation of what the practice involves and does not involve
- Right to withdraw at any time without explanation
- Right to privacy about inner experience
- No pressure for "successful" connection
- Post-practice debrief with permission to share or not

## Evidence Honesty

> **Evidence level: Preliminary**
>
> In Grinberg's laboratory, separated meditation partners showed correlated
> brain activity approximately 25% of the time (across 50+ experiments).
> This finding has had limited independent replication. These practices
> are offered as shared contemplative exploration, not as evidence of
> telepathy or paranormal connection.

## What This Practice Is NOT

- NOT telepathy or mind-reading
- NOT guaranteed to produce shared experiences
- NOT a way to prove paranormal connection
- NOT a substitute for professional relationship support

Both "connection" and "no connection" are normal, expected outcomes.

## Quality Gates

Before output is finalized:

- Consent framework complete and comprehensive
- Right to withdraw explicitly stated
- ~25% response rate honestly presented
- No telepathy or paranormal claims
- Both connection and no-connection normalized
- Sharing is optional
- Power dynamics acknowledged
- Grounding techniques included
- Grinberg properly attributed
- Ethics guardian approval obtained

*Connection cannot be forced. We create the conditions, then honor whatever arises — or doesn't.*
