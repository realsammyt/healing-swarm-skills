# water-healing

**Trigger:** `/water-healing`

Therapeutic water practice protocols drawing from diverse healing traditions. Combines thermoregulation physiology, cardiovascular responses to water immersion, and hydrotherapy principles with knowledge of ritual bathing traditions, contrast therapy, and thermal water healing.

## Overview

Water healing extends the existing [cold exposure skill](./whm-cold-exposure.mdx) into the full temperature spectrum — from warm hand baths through contrast showers to full immersion protocols. It also provides respectful education about ritual bathing traditions across cultures.

Water demands the highest safety standards of any physical practice. Drowning risk, cardiac stress from temperature extremes, and burn risk are real dangers that are never minimized.

## Relationship to Cold Exposure Skill

| Cold Exposure Skill Handles | Water Healing Adds |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| WHM cold exposure progression | Warm water practices (baths, foot baths) |
| Cold shower and ice bath protocols | Contrast therapy (warm-cool alternation) |
| Cold-specific safety architecture | Ritual bathing education (cultural context) |
| Breathwork-cold integration | Kneipp method, onsen principles |

The two skills complement each other. Cold immersion safety defers to the cold-exposure-guide. This skill adds warmth, contrast, and cultural context.

## Progressive Levels

| Level | Practice | Risk | Partner |
|-------|----------|------|---------|
| Beginner | Warm hand/foot bath | Low | Not required |
| Beginner+ | Warm full bath | Low-moderate | Not required |
| Developing | Warm bath with cool finish | Low-moderate | Not required |
| Intermediate | Contrast shower | Moderate | Not required |
| Advanced | Contrast immersion | Moderate | Recommended |
| Advanced+ | Cold immersion (via cold-exposure skill) | Higher | **Required** |

## Traditions Covered

| Tradition | Practice | Period | Our Role |
|-----------|----------|--------|----------|
| Jewish | Mikveh (ritual immersion) | Second Temple period | Educational reference only |
| Japanese | Onsen / Sento (communal bathing) | Ancient, Shinto roots | Principle of intentional bathing |
| German naturopathy | Kneipp method (five pillars) | 19th century CE | Primary contrast protocol source |
| Finnish | Sauna tradition | UNESCO heritage (2020) | Heat-cool-rest contrast principle |
| Islamic | Wudu (ritual washing) | Ancient | Educational reference only |
| Hindu | Snana (ritual bathing) | Ancient | Educational reference only |

:::warning Religious Practice Boundaries
Ritual bathing practices from specific religious traditions (mikveh, wudu, snana) have specific requirements, authorities, and contexts. We provide **educational context**, not instructional guidance. Users who wish to practice these rituals should consult the appropriate religious authority.

## Agents

- **Water/Hydrotherapy Healing Guide** — Protocol design with full temperature safety
- **Traditions Scholar** — Mikveh, onsen, Kneipp, Finnish sauna cultural context
- **Clinical Researcher** — Contrast therapy evidence, cardiovascular safety
- **Content Writer** — Safety-conscious practice language
- **Ethics Guardian** — Drowning safety, religious practice boundaries, evidence claims

## Usage

**Beginner contrast shower:**
```bash
/water-healing "beginner contrast shower" --level developing
```

**Warm foot bath for evening relaxation:**
```bash
/water-healing "evening foot bath" --level beginner
```

**Research on contrast therapy:**
```bash
/water-healing "contrast therapy for recovery" --level intermediate
```

## Evidence Summary

> **Evidence level: Moderate (for contrast therapy and warm bathing)**
>
> Versey et al. (2013): Contrast water therapy for exercise recovery. Laukkanen et al. (2018): Sauna bathing and cardiovascular benefits. Kneipp method: Moderate evidence for contrast applications. Warm bathing 1-2 hours before bed shows moderate evidence for sleep improvement.
>
> All protocols use appropriate evidence language.

## Safety Considerations

:::danger Critical Water Safety
- **DROWNING RISK** — NEVER practice alone in water deep enough to submerge your face. Partner or spotter required for any immersion practice.
- **NEVER** fall asleep in a bath or hot tub
- **CARDIAC RISK** — Extreme temperature water is a significant cardiovascular stressor. Medical screening required for anyone with heart conditions.
- **BURN RISK** — Always test water temperature. Maximum safe bath: 104F / 40C.
- **NEVER** combine water practices with alcohol or sedatives
- Get out immediately if you experience chest pain, dizziness, confusion, or extreme fatigue
:::

**Contraindications:** Cardiovascular disease, history of heart attack/stroke/TIA, Raynaud's phenomenon, pregnancy (hot baths above 100F/38C contraindicated), epilepsy/seizure disorders, open wounds, uncontrolled diabetes, severe varicose veins/DVT, recent surgery, fever, alcohol or sedative use.

## Ethics Framework

All water healing content is reviewed against the [Ethics Framework](../ethics/index.mdx):

- Drowning safety is the primary safety concern — never minimized
- Religious water practices (mikveh, wudu, snana) referenced educationally, never instructionally
- Temperature safety within documented safe ranges
- Not everyone has a bathtub — shower and hand/foot bath alternatives always provided
- Cardiac risk clearly communicated for temperature extremes
- "Temperature is not a competition" — no performance mindset
