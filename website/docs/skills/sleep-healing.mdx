# sleep-healing

**Triggers:** `/sleep-healing` and `/dream-practice`

Evening wind-down protocols, sleep-supportive meditations, and dream work practices drawn from diverse healing traditions. Combines sleep physiology, circadian rhythm science, and traditional dream practices with practical sleep hygiene, bedtime ritual design, and dream journaling.

## Overview

Sleep healing honors the body's natural descent into rest. The skill designs structured evening routines following a "progressive dimming" model — from day-closing activities through gentle wind-down to bedtime meditation — and extends into dream journaling and contemplative dream practices for those who wish to explore the dream state.

The skill never promises specific sleep outcomes or claims to cure insomnia. For persistent insomnia, it recommends CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) as the evidence-based first-line treatment.

## Traditions Covered

| Tradition | Practice | Period | Focus |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------|
| Greek | Asclepian dream temples | c. 500 BCE | Dream incubation for healing |
| Tibetan Buddhist | Dream yoga (Naropa's Six Yogas) | 11th century CE | Contemplative dream practice |
| Traditional Chinese Medicine | Organ clock theory | Ancient | Sleep timing, liver-blood relationship |
| Ayurvedic | Dinacharya (daily routine) | Ancient | Evening rituals, warm milk, oiling feet |
| Jewish | Dream interpretation (Talmud Berakhot 55a-57b) | Ancient | Dream as meaningful experience |
| Modern behavioral | CBT-I, sleep hygiene | 20th century | Evidence-based sleep improvement |

## Agents

- **Sleep Healing Guide** — Wind-down, meditation, and dream work protocol design
- **Traditions Scholar** — Cross-cultural dream traditions and sleep rituals
- **Clinical Researcher** — Sleep hygiene evidence, CBT-I components, melatonin science
- **Content Writer** — Gentle, descending language for sleep-approach content
- **Ethics Guardian** — Safety, referral criteria, and screen paradox review

## Usage

**Beginner evening wind-down:**
```bash
/sleep-healing "evening routine for trouble falling asleep" --level beginner
```

**Dream journaling practice:**
```bash
/dream-practice "start dream journaling" --level intermediate
```

**Advanced dream incubation:**
```bash
/dream-practice "dream incubation for creative insight" --level advanced
```

:::warning The Screen Paradox
When guiding practices delivered via a device screen, the skill mandates: dark mode with warm color temperature, minimum brightness, auto-shutoff after practice, and audio-only recommendations. It honestly acknowledges the contradiction and always offers print-friendly and memorized-routine alternatives.
:::

## Evidence Summary

> **Evidence level: Strong (sleep hygiene), Moderate (dream work)**
>
> Sleep hygiene: Strong evidence base from behavioral sleep medicine. CBT-I is the gold standard first-line treatment for insomnia. Yoga nidra: Moderate evidence for sleep quality improvement. Dream journaling: Moderate evidence for emotional processing. Dream incubation: Preliminary evidence, with deep traditional roots across cultures.
>
> Lucid dreaming research is emerging. All protocols use appropriate evidence language.

## Safety Considerations

:::danger Referral Triggers
- **Persistent insomnia** (3+ nights/week for 3+ months): Recommend CBT-I
- **Excessive daytime sleepiness**: Recommend sleep medicine evaluation
- **Sleep paralysis, acting out dreams, unusual sleep behaviors**: Recommend sleep medicine evaluation
- **Severe nightmares impacting daily function**: Recommend trauma-informed therapy (IRT)
:::

**Contraindications for dream practices:** Narcolepsy, parasomnia (sleepwalking, sleep eating), untreated sleep apnea, dissociative disorders (lucid dreaming contraindicated), active psychosis (dream work contraindicated).

## Ethics Framework

All sleep healing content is reviewed against the [Ethics Framework](../ethics/index.mdx):

- Never promises specific sleep outcomes
- CBT-I recommended as first-line for persistent insomnia
- Gentle, permission-based language — "Allow your eyes to close," not "Close your eyes"
- Dream interpretation framed as subjective — "You might explore what this image means to you"
- Screen paradox addressed honestly in every digital delivery
- No stimulating practices within 2 hours of bed
