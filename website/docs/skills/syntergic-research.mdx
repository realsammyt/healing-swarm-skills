# syntergic-research

**Trigger:** `/syntergic-research`

Deep research into Grinberg's consciousness science, bridging syntergic theory with mainstream neuroscience and contextualizing his shamanic observations.

## Agents

- **Consciousness Researcher** - Grinberg's published works and theories
- **Traditions Scholar** - Shamanic and Indigenous healing context
- **Clinical Researcher** - Mainstream consciousness research
- **Mechanisms Neuroscientist** - Theory-neuroscience bridging
- **Ethics Guardian** - Evidence claims and cultural sensitivity

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | Yes | Research topic or question |
| `depth` | No | `quick`, `standard`, `comprehensive` |
| `focus` | No | Specific domain (syntergic theory, transferred potential, orbitals, shamanic) |

## Outputs

- `syntergic-research-brief.md` - Comprehensive research document
- `grinberg-bibliography.md` - Complete citation list
- `shamanic-context.md` - Cultural context (Grinberg's work with Pachita)
- `honest-assessment.md` - Strengths and limitations

## Examples

**Quick overview:**
```bash
/syntergic-research "syntergic theory overview" --depth quick
```

**Deep dive on transferred potential:**
```bash
/syntergic-research "transferred potential experiments" --depth comprehensive
```

**Shamanic research context:**
```bash
/syntergic-research "Grinberg Pachita shamanic research" --depth standard
```

## Research Domains

| Domain | Key Topics | Evidence Status |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Syntergic Theory | Neuronal field, the Lattice, brain-consciousness interaction | Theoretical |
| Transferred Potential | Correlated EEG between separated meditators (~25% response) | Preliminary |
| Interhemispheric Coherence | Alpha/theta synchronization during meditation | Preliminary (mainstream support) |
| Consciousness Orbitals | Bodily → emotional → mental → transpersonal → unity | Theoretical |
| Shamanic Research | Work with Pachita, observed healing phenomena | Observational |

## Research Process

1. **Intake** - Parse query, identify Grinberg topics and mainstream bridges
2. **Parallel Research** - Consciousness researcher + traditions scholar + clinical researcher work simultaneously
3. **Mechanism Analysis** - Bridge Grinberg's theories with current neuroscience
4. **Synthesis** - Integrate all research strands with honest assessment
5. **Ethics Review** - Verify evidence claims and cultural sensitivity

## Evidence Standards

All outputs must:
- Label evidence levels explicitly (theoretical / preliminary / research-supported)
- State sample sizes when citing studies
- Note limited independent replication
- Use "suggests" language, never "proves" or "demonstrates"
- Distinguish Grinberg's theories from mainstream neuroscience
- Acknowledge his 1994 disappearance ended the research program

## Cultural Sensitivity

When addressing Grinberg's shamanic research:
- Present Grinberg as researcher/documenter, not tradition holder
- Acknowledge Indigenous healing as living, owned tradition
- Do not reproduce specific ceremonial practices
- Cultural reviewer approval required for shamanic content

## Quality Gates

Before output is finalized:

- Every claim labeled with evidence level
- Sample sizes stated for cited studies
- Replication status noted for key findings
- Grinberg attributed to UNAM (1970s-1994)
- Biographical accuracy (no speculation about disappearance)
- Cultural sensitivity reviewed for shamanic content
- Balanced presentation (strengths AND limitations)
- No overclaims about Lattice, telepathy, or brainwave states
