## Three Pillars Integration

| Pillar | Focus | Daily Practice |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| 1. Breathing | Controlled hyperventilation + retention | Morning session, 15-25 min |
| 2. Cold Exposure | Progressive cold adaptation | After breathing or separate, 2-10 min |
| 3. Commitment | Meditation, mindset, consistency | Evening, 5-20 min |

> **CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE:** Full WHM breathing causes temporary hypocapnia
> (low CO2), which can impair the urge to breathe. In water, this creates
> drowning risk. Only use gentle, controlled breaths before cold exposure.
> Never combine full breathing rounds with water immersion.

## Progress Tracking

Each week includes check-in questions:
- How does your body respond to cold now vs. week 1?
- What's your natural breath retention becoming?
- What patterns do you notice in your commitment practice?

Progression criteria are based on **comfort and consistency**, never endurance or competition.
