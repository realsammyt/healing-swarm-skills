# Safety Infrastructure (P0)

The safety infrastructure underpins every skill in the healing swarm. It is not a single skill but a foundational layer — the architecture that makes all other practices safe to offer. Every new skill added to the system must integrate with this infrastructure before deployment.

## Overview

Safety is not an afterthought. It is the foundation on which every practice is built. The healing swarm's safety infrastructure includes four interlocking systems:

1. **Crisis Response Protocols** — What happens when a practice surfaces acute distress
2. **Contraindication Database** — Which practices are unsafe for which conditions
3. **Outcome Measurement Framework** — How we know whether practices are helping
4. **Practice Pathways** — How skills connect and support each other

## 1. Crisis Response Protocols

Every skill in the system includes crisis response readiness. The protocols follow a tiered model:

### Tier 1: In-Practice Safety

Built into every practice at every level:

- **Exit ramps** — explicit permission to stop at any time (minimum 3 per practice for grief/inquiry)
- **Grounding protocols** — body-based return to ordinary awareness
- **Normalization language** — "Whatever you experience is valid, including nothing"
- **"Nothing happened" is valid** — no performance pressure

### Tier 2: Distress Response

When a practice surfaces acute emotional distress:

- **Pause the practice** — immediate, without judgment
- **Run grounding protocol** — specific to the practice type
- **Normalize the experience** — "This can happen. It doesn't mean something is wrong with you."
- **Offer choice** — continue, modify, or stop entirely
- **Follow up** — if in a group setting, facilitator checks in after session

### Tier 3: Crisis Referral

When distress exceeds what any practice can hold:

:::danger Crisis Resources
- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988 (US)
- **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741 (US)
- **International:** [IASP Crisis Centres](https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/)

These resources are included in every grief practice, every inquiry practice, and any practice with psychological depth.

### Referral Triggers

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Suicidal ideation expressed | Immediate crisis resource provision, practice paused |
| Persistent dissociation (>10 min) | Grounding, suggest professional support |
| Psychotic symptoms | Do not continue practice, refer to mental health professional |
| Grief intensifying after 12+ months | Recommend grief-specialized therapist |
| Persistent insomnia (3+ nights/week, 3+ months) | Recommend CBT-I |
| Acting out dreams, sleep paralysis | Recommend sleep medicine evaluation |

## 2. Contraindication Database

Every skill screens for contraindications before practice begins. The database is organized by condition, mapping to which practices are safe, which require modification, and which are contraindicated.

### Sample Contraindication Matrix

| Condition | Sound | Somatic | Sleep | Nature | Water | Grief | Expressive | Inquiry |
|-----------|:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|:----------:|:-------:|
| Active psychosis | Modify | Modify | Contra | Safe | Contra | Contra | Contra | Contra |
| Dissociative disorders | Modify | Safe | Modify | Safe | Contra | Modify | Contra | Contra |
| Severe depression | Safe | Safe | Safe | Safe | Safe | Modify | Modify | Contra |
| Cardiac conditions | Safe | Modify | Safe | Safe | Contra | Safe | Safe | Safe |
| Pregnancy | Safe | Modify | Safe | Safe | Modify | Safe | Safe | Safe |
| Epilepsy | Modify | Modify | Safe | Safe | Contra | Safe | Safe | Safe |
| PTSD (unsupported) | Modify | Modify | Modify | Safe | Safe | Contra | Contra | Contra |

**Legend:** Safe = proceed normally. Modify = practice with specific modifications. Contra = contraindicated, do not offer.

:::tip Living Document
The contraindication database is continuously refined as new evidence emerges and new skills are added. It draws from clinical guidelines, published contraindication literature, and conservative safety principles. When in doubt, the system errs on the side of caution.

## 3. Outcome Measurement Framework

How do we know whether practices are helping? The outcome measurement framework provides structured ways to track practice effects without creating performance pressure.

### Measurement Principles

- **Self-reported only** — practitioners assess their own experience
- **No targets** — measurement is for awareness, not achievement
- **Optional** — tracking is always voluntary
- **Private** — data stays with the practitioner
- **Patterns over points** — trends matter more than individual sessions

### Measurement Domains

| Domain | What It Tracks | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Practice engagement | Frequency, duration, consistency | "I practiced 3 times this week" |
| Subjective experience | Quality of practice, emotional tone | "Today felt grounding" |
| Functional wellbeing | Sleep, energy, social connection | "Sleep has improved over 2 weeks" |
| Safety events | Distress episodes, exits, referrals | "I used the exit ramp on Day 3" |
| Practice progression | Level changes, new practices explored | "Ready to try walking meditation" |

### The "Did This Help?" Framework

After any practice, practitioners may reflect:

1. **Body:** How does my body feel compared to before?
2. **Mind:** Has anything shifted in my thinking or attention?
3. **Emotion:** What is my emotional state?
4. **Connection:** Do I feel more or less connected (to self, others, world)?
5. **Safety:** Did I feel safe throughout the practice?

## 4. Practice Pathways and Cross-Skill Integration

The healing skills are not isolated — they form an interconnected web. Practice pathways help practitioners discover natural connections between skills.

### Cross-Skill Connections

```
Sound Healing ---- extends to ----> Breathwork (breath-synchronized chanting)
    |
Somatic Movement -- extends to ----> Nature Healing (outdoor walking meditation)
    |
Sleep Healing ---- integrates ----> Sound (evening chanting), Nature (sunset practice)
    |
Water Healing ---- extends -------> Cold Exposure (existing skill)
    |
Grief Healing ---- integrates ----> Expressive (writing for grief), Community (group grief)
    |
Expressive ------- integrates ----> Grief (creative mourning), Sound (sacred poetry)
    |
Community --------- integrates ---> All practices (group versions of individual practices)
    |
PNI Research ------ strengthens --> Evidence base for all skills
    |
Contemplative Inquiry -- extends -> Language Awareness (existing skill)
```

### Starter Pathways

For practitioners wondering where to begin:

| Starting Point | Recommended First Skill | Natural Progression |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| "I'm stressed" | Somatic Movement (body scan) | Breathwork, Sound, Nature |
| "I can't sleep" | Sleep Healing (wind-down) | Sound (humming), Nature (evening) |
| "I'm grieving" | Grief Healing (acknowledging) | Expressive (journaling), Community |
| "I want to explore my mind" | Language Awareness | Contemplative Inquiry |
| "I need connection" | Community Healing (dyad) | Somatic (group), Sound (group chanting) |
| "I'm curious about the science" | PNI Research | Any practice with evidence mapping |

## Integration with Ethics Framework

The safety infrastructure is deeply integrated with the [Ethics Framework](../ethics/index.mdx):

- **Non-maleficence** — The contraindication database prevents harm before it occurs
- **Autonomy** — Exit ramps and optional measurement preserve practitioner agency
- **Honest framing** — Outcome measurement never promises specific results
- **Accountability** — Safety events are tracked so protocols can be improved
- **Compassion** — Crisis response treats distress with care, not judgment

## For Skill Developers

When adding new skills to the healing swarm, the following safety integration is required:

1. **Contraindication list** — What conditions make this practice unsafe?
2. **Modification matrix** — How is the practice adapted for each condition?
3. **Safety warnings** — What are the practice-specific dangers?
4. **Exit ramps** — Where can practitioners stop safely?
5. **Grounding protocol** — How do practitioners return to ordinary awareness?
6. **Crisis readiness** — Does this practice type need crisis resources?
7. **Cross-skill connections** — How does this skill relate to others?
8. **Evidence review** — What evidence supports this practice's safety profile?

*"Safety is not the absence of risk. It is the presence of care — at every level, for every practitioner, in every practice."*
