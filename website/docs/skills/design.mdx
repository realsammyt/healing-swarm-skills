## Design Principles

### Healing-First Design

- **Calm, not cluttered** - Reduce cognitive load
- **Gentle, not aggressive** - No harsh colors or animations
- **Empowering, not prescriptive** - User maintains control
- **Private, not social** - No sharing pressure

### Accessibility Requirements

All designs must meet:

- WCAG AA minimum (AAA preferred)
- Support for reduced motion
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- One-handed operation
- Works offline

### Visual Language

**Colors:**
- Soft, natural palette
- High contrast for readability
- No red for critical actions (trauma-aware)

**Typography:**
- Readable fonts (16px+ body text)
- Clear hierarchy
- Generous spacing

**Motion:**
- Subtle, purposeful
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Never required for comprehension
