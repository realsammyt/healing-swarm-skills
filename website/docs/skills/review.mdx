- No closed/initiatory practices disclosed
- No cultural appropriation
- Medical disclaimers present
- Grounding techniques included
- Permission to stop built in

**Severity Levels:**
- **CRITICAL** - Blocks deployment immediately
- **HIGH** - Must fix before deployment
- **MEDIUM** - Should fix soon
- **LOW** - Consider fixing

### Clinical Review

Verifies accuracy of health claims.

**Checks:**
- Evidence language matches strength
- Sample sizes noted
- Limitations acknowledged
- Contraindications documented
- Mechanisms accurately described
- Citations valid (PMID/DOI)

### Cultural Review

Ensures respect for source traditions.

**Checks:**
- Traditions specifically named (not "Eastern wisdom")
- Era/dates provided
- Primary sources cited
- Adaptations noted
- Closed practices protected
