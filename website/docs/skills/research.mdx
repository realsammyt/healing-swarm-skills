# healing-research

**Trigger:** `/healing-research`

Deep research into healing traditions and clinical evidence, coordinating multiple specialized research agents.

## Agents

- **Traditions Scholar** - Ancient healing practices
- **Clinical Researcher** - Modern evidence review
- **Mechanisms Neuroscientist** - Science-tradition bridging

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | Yes | Research topic or question |
| `depth` | No | `quick`, `standard`, `comprehensive` |
| `traditions` | No | Specific traditions to research |

## Outputs

- `research-brief.md` - Comprehensive summary
- `traditions-research.md` - Traditional healing research
- `clinical-evidence.md` - Clinical evidence review
- `mechanism-bridges.md` - Science-tradition connections

## Examples

**Quick research:**
```bash
/healing-research "acupressure for headache" --depth quick
```

**Comprehensive research:**
```bash
/healing-research "meditation for chronic pain" --depth comprehensive
```

**Specific tradition:**
```bash
/healing-research "pranayama breathing" --traditions "Vedic"
```

## Research Process

1. **Query Parsing** - Extract key concepts and constraints
2. **Parallel Research** - All three agents work simultaneously
3. **Synthesis** - Combine findings into unified brief
4. **Ethics Review** - Verify all claims are appropriately qualified

## Output Format
