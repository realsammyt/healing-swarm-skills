# orbital-journey

**Trigger:** `/orbital-journey`

Progressive multi-day journeys through Grinberg's consciousness orbitals, with comprehensive safety architecture.

## Agents

- **Consciousness Researcher** - Orbital theory and practice foundations
- **Orbital Architect** - Multi-day journey design and safety architecture
- **Coherence Guide** - Individual daily practice creation
- **Content Writer** - Daily content and journal prompts
- **Ethics Guardian** - CRITICAL review for transpersonal content

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `duration` | No | `7` (bodily only), `21` (full, default), `28` (advanced) |
| `level` | No | `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced` |
| `focus` | No | Specific intention for the journey |

## Outputs

- `journey-map.md` - Complete journey structure with daily summaries
- `daily-practices/` - All daily practice content
- `orbital-guide.md` - Explanation of consciousness orbitals
- `safety-protocols.md` - Grounding, screening, and integration
- `progress-tracker.md` - Daily self-assessment template

## Examples

**7-day bodily foundation:**
```bash
/orbital-journey --duration 7 --level beginner
```

**21-day full journey:**
```bash
/orbital-journey --duration 21 --level intermediate
```

**28-day advanced with Lattice:**
```bash
/orbital-journey --duration 28 --level advanced
```

## Orbital Progression

| Days | Orbital | Focus | Safety Level |
|------|---------|-------|:---:|
| 1-7 | Bodily/Sensory | Physical awareness, interoception | Standard |
| 8-14 | Emotional | Feeling-field awareness without reaction | Enhanced |
| 15-19 | Mental | Witness consciousness, thought observation | Enhanced |
| 20-21 | Transpersonal | Unity consciousness, field awareness | Maximum |
| 25-28* | Lattice Connection* | Sensing the underlying field | Maximum |

*\*28-day advanced journey only. Requires completion of 21-day journey.*

## Daily Structure

Each day includes:

| Session | Duration | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Morning Practice | 20-30 min | Grounding anchor + main orbital practice + integration |
| Midday Check-In | 5 min | Self-assessment and micro-practice |
| Evening Reflection | 10-15 min | Settling practice + journal prompt |

**Integration days** are built in at orbital transitions (Days 7, 14, 19) — no new practices, gentle review and rest.

## Safety Architecture

### Screening

Before transpersonal content (Day 20+), participants self-assess for:

- Active psychosis or psychotic features
- Active dissociative disorders
- Severe untreated PTSD
- Current mania or hypomania

If any are present, the journey ends at the mental orbital (Day 19) or is limited to the 7-day bodily program. **This is not a limitation — it is appropriate care.**

### Grounding

- **Standard** (Days 1-7): Grounding anchor at start of each session
- **Enhanced** (Days 8-19): Grounding before AND after each practice
- **Maximum** (Days 20+): Intensive grounding before, during, and after

### Distress Protocol

If a participant experiences persistent anxiety, dissociation, or sleep disruption:

1. Stop all practices immediately
2. Use grounding protocol (5-4-3-2-1 sensory exercise)
3. Contact identified support person
4. Seek professional help if symptoms persist
5. Resume only with professional guidance

## Research Basis

> **Evidence level: Theoretical Model**
>
> Consciousness orbitals are a theoretical framework proposed by
> Dr. Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum. They are not scientifically
> validated levels of consciousness. The progression from bodily
> to transpersonal awareness draws on contemplative traditions
> and Grinberg's theoretical model, not on controlled studies.
> Individual practice elements (body scan, breath awareness,
> emotional regulation) have varying levels of mainstream
> research support.

## Quality Gates

Before output is finalized:

- Progressive difficulty matches orbital model
- Integration days present at orbital transitions
- Screening gate before transpersonal content
- Grounding anchor in every daily practice
- Exit ramps clearly documented
- Orbitals labeled as theoretical model
- Grinberg properly attributed
- No guaranteed outcomes
- Professional resources listed
- Ethics guardian approval for all transpersonal content

*Each day is a step on the path. The path matters more than the destination. Walk gently.*
