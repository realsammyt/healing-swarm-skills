# nature-healing

**Trigger:** `/nature-healing`

Structured nature immersion protocols, earthing practices, and sensory engagement with the natural world. Combines environmental psychology, attention restoration theory, and stress physiology with traditional nature-based healing practices from diverse cultures.

## Overview

Nature-based healing begins with a fundamental principle: nature is everywhere. From a single weed in a sidewalk crack to a vast forest canopy, the natural world is present. The skill designs practices across a full spectrum of accessibility — from window gazing and indoor plant engagement through park visits to extended forest immersion.

Every practice includes an urban or indoor alternative. These are not "lesser" options — they are equally valid practices for connecting with the natural world from wherever you are.

## Practice Spectrum

| Level | Setting | Duration | Access Required |
|-------|---------|----------|----------------|
| Window Gazing | Indoor | 5-10 min | A window (or indoor plants) |
| Doorstep Practice | Threshold | 5-15 min | A door to outside |
| Park Visit | Local green space | 20-30 min | Nearby park or garden |
| Forest Immersion | Forested area | 1-3 hours | Forest or large wooded park |
| Extended Retreat | Natural setting | Multi-day | Significant planning |

## Traditions Covered

| Tradition | Practice | Period | Focus |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------|
| Japanese | Shinrin-yoku (forest bathing) | Formalized 1982, Shinto roots older | Deep sensory nature immersion |
| Cross-cultural | Earthing / grounding | Ancient | Direct physical contact with earth |
| European medieval | Monastic healing gardens | Medieval | Horticultural healing |
| Traditional Chinese Medicine | Five Element nature observation | Ancient | Seasonal attunement |
| General | Garden therapy, sky gazing | Universal | Sensory engagement with nature |

## The Sensory Engagement Framework

Every nature practice follows a five-sense structure:

```
Arrival (settle into the space)
    |
SEE -- Soft visual attention (receiving, not analyzing)
    |
HEAR -- Ambient sound awareness (layers near and far)
    |
SMELL -- Atmospheric scents (earth, plants, air, rain)
    |
TOUCH -- Physical sensation (air on skin, ground underfoot)
    |
TASTE -- (Optional) Taste the air, mindful tea, edible plants
    |
Integration -- Whole-body presence in the natural world
    |
Closing -- Gratitude and gentle transition back
```

## Agents

- **Nature-Based Healing Guide** — Protocol design with urban and indoor alternatives
- **Traditions Scholar** — Shinrin-yoku history, Five Element context, monastic gardens
- **Clinical Researcher** — Forest bathing evidence, attention restoration theory, earthing research
- **Content Writer** — Sensory engagement language
- **Ethics Guardian** — Environmental privilege awareness, Indigenous practice boundaries

## Usage

**Urban apartment dweller:**
```bash
/nature-healing "city apartment practice" --setting indoor
```

**Park visit with sensory walk:**
```bash
/nature-healing "sensory walk in local park" --level intermediate --duration 30
```

**Full shinrin-yoku session:**
```bash
/nature-healing "forest bathing" --level advanced --duration 120
```

:::tip Urban and Indoor Alternatives Always Available
Every single nature practice includes a complete urban or indoor alternative. "Even a single dandelion in a sidewalk crack is nature asserting itself." Window gazing, indoor plant engagement, and doorstep practices are complete practices — never compromises.

## Evidence Summary

> **Evidence level: Moderate to Strong (for forest bathing)**
>
> Li (2010) and Li et al. (2007): 60+ forest bathing studies showing cortisol reduction and NK cell activity enhancement. Bratman et al. (2019): Green space exposure and mental health benefits. Kaplan (1995): Attention Restoration Theory — nature exposure restores directed attention. Buxton et al. (2021): Nature sounds reduce stress responses.
>
> Earthing evidence is **preliminary** (Oschman et al., 2015). We say so clearly. The experiential value of nature contact does not need inflated claims.

## Safety Considerations

:::warning Outdoor Safety
- Check weather conditions before outdoor practice
- Sun exposure awareness — sunscreen, hat, shade
- Terrain assessment — appropriate footwear, mobility considerations
- Wildlife awareness — local animals, insects, plants
- Allergy awareness — pollen, plant contact, insect stings
- Hydration — bring water for practices over 20 minutes
- Tell someone where you're going for longer practices
:::

**Environmental Privilege Awareness:** Not everyone has safe access to green spaces. Not everyone can walk or stand outdoors. Not everyone lives in a climate suitable for year-round outdoor practice. Indoor alternatives are always provided — never as lesser options.

## Ethics Framework

All nature healing content is reviewed against the [Ethics Framework](../ethics/index.mdx):

- Indigenous land-based healing traditions referenced educationally, not instructionally
- Aboriginal Australian land connection practices: educational reference only
- Nature framed as subject, not object — "Spend time WITH the tree," not "Use the tree for grounding"
- Reciprocity, not extraction — we reconnect with a relationship that heals both ways
- Earthing evidence honestly qualified as preliminary
- Seasonal and climate adaptations for every practice
