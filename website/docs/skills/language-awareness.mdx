# language-awareness

**Trigger:** `/language-awareness`

Individual cognitive deautomatization practices that reveal how language shapes perception and identity. Based on research by Deikman (1966), semantic satiation studies, and practices from Chase Hughes' *Tongue: A Cognitive Hazard* (2024), with cross-tradition parallels from Zen, Dzogchen, phenomenology, and vipassana.

## Agents

- **Language Awareness Guide** - Deautomatization protocol design
- **Traditions Scholar** - Zen, Dzogchen, phenomenology parallels
- **Clinical Researcher** - Deikman 1966, semantic satiation evidence
- **Content Writer** - Practice language polishing
- **Ethics Guardian** - Psychological safety review

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `focus` | Yes | Practice focus or request |
| `level` | No | `observation`, `interruption`, `substitution`, `integration` |
| `duration` | No | Practice duration (default: level-appropriate) |

## Outputs

- `language-awareness-protocol.md` - Complete practice guide with safety framing
- `grounding-guide.md` - Pocket Exit and Reintegration Ritual
- `journal-prompts.md` - Perception journal questions

## Examples

**Beginner observation practice:**
```bash
/language-awareness "first practice" --level observation
```

**Intermediate interruption exercises:**
```bash
/language-awareness "create gaps in naming" --level interruption
```

**Full 8-week curriculum:**
```bash
/language-awareness "full program" --duration 8 --level observation
```

## Progressive Levels

| Level | Name | Weeks | Focus | Session |
|-------|------|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Observation | 1-2 | Notice automatic labeling | 3-5 min |
| 2 | Interruption | 3-4 | Create gaps in naming process | 5-10 min |
| 3 | Substitution | 5-6 | Replace labels with sensation | 10-15 min |
| 4 | Integration | 7-8 | Flexible language engagement | 20-30 min |

### Level 1: Observation ("See the Naming")
- Label delay: withhold naming objects for 5-10 seconds
- Thought-catching: notice declarative thoughts as they form
- Pocket Exit grounding taught first

### Level 2: Interruption ("Break the Loop")
- "I" tracing: trace actions back to the last word that preceded them
- Glitch sequences: repeat phrases until meaning collapses
- Noun fasting: narrate using only verbs and sensations

### Level 3: Substitution ("Rewire the Map")
- Metaphor swap: translate emotions into physical metaphors
- Scene peeling: strip labels from memories, keep only sensation
- Word-touch meditation: "read" temperature instead of content

### Level 4: Integration ("Live Before Description")
- Extended silence blocks (30+ minutes)
- Real-time un-naming walks
- Reintegration ritual for chosen return to language

## Safety Architecture

> **IMPORTANT:** These practices temporarily change how you experience thoughts
> and self-perception. This is expected and usually resolves within minutes.
>
> **Contraindications** (do NOT practice if):
> - Active psychosis or psychotic features
> - Active dissociative disorders
> - Severe depersonalization/derealization disorder
> - PTSD without therapeutic support
> - Mania or hypomania
> - Acute mental health crisis
>
> **Always have grounding available.** Stop immediately if you feel panicked,
> severely disoriented, or disconnected from reality in a frightening way.

## Grounding Protocols

**Pocket Exit (Quick Grounding):**
1. Tongue tip to roof of mouth, behind front teeth
2. Left thumb to sternum center, press lightly
3. Breathe: in for 4 heartbeats, out for 6
4. Look at nearest object — name it deliberately
5. Say one useful number aloud

**Reintegration Ritual (Full Grounding):**
1. Open both eyes wide
2. Wiggle toes, stretch fingers
3. Touch the back of your neck
4. Name 5 things you see, 4 you touch, 3 you hear
5. Say one useful number aloud
6. Wait until language feels normal before moving on

## Research Basis

> **Evidence level: Moderate (for underlying principles)**
>
> Deikman (1966): "Deautomatization and the Mystic Experience" — foundational
> paper on how attention reverses cognitive automation. Jakobovits & Lambert
> (1962): Semantic satiation research showing repeated word exposure reduces
> perceived meaning. Mindfulness research broadly supports observational
> practices for cognitive flexibility. Direct research on these specific
> exercises is limited.
