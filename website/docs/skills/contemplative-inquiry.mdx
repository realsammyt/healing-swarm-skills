# contemplative-inquiry

**Trigger:** `/contemplative-inquiry`

Practices that use questioning, investigation, and structured reflection as contemplative and therapeutic tools. Draws on multiple inquiry traditions — Zen koan practice, Advaitic self-inquiry, Socratic questioning, Ignatian Examen, philosophical counseling, and modern cognitive defusion — to create safe, progressive protocols for examining one's relationship to suffering, identity, and healing.

## Overview

Contemplative inquiry extends the [language awareness skill](./language-awareness.mdx) into deeper territory. Where language awareness asks "What happens when I stop naming?" — contemplative inquiry asks "Who is the one naming?" Where language awareness reveals the machinery of perception, contemplative inquiry investigates the perceiver.

The question itself is the practice. The answer may never come — and that is also healing.

## Relationship to Language Awareness

```
Language Awareness (Levels 1-4)
  Notice automatic labeling -> create gaps -> replace labels -> flexible engagement
    | extends into
Contemplative Inquiry
  Structured reflection -> guided questioning -> open inquiry -> silent investigation
```

Language awareness builds the capacity to observe mental processes. Contemplative inquiry uses that capacity to investigate fundamental questions. A practitioner who has done language awareness work will find inquiry more accessible — but inquiry can also be entered directly at Level 1.

## Progressive Levels

| Level | Practice | Duration | Risk | Focus |
|-------|----------|----------|------|-------|
| 1. Structured Reflection | Guided journaling, Ignatian Examen | 10-15 min | Low | Reflective attention habit |
| 2. Guided Questioning | Socratic questioning, cognitive defusion | 15-20 min | Moderate | Examining assumptions |
| 3. Open Inquiry | Koan-inspired questions, Advaitic self-inquiry | 20-30 min | Higher | Inquiry below conceptual level |
| 4. Silent Investigation | Wordless contemplation, awareness investigating itself | 30+ min | Highest | Inquiry beyond language |

:::warning Progressive Safety
Levels 3-4 are not "better" — they are appropriate for different temperaments and stages of practice. Many practitioners will remain at Levels 1-2 and benefit enormously. Level 4 ideally requires teacher support and stable meditation practice.

## Traditions Covered

| Tradition | Practice | Period | Our Approach |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Zen Buddhism (Rinzai) | Koan practice | 12th century | Koan-*inspired* questions; not formal koan transmission |
| Advaita Vedanta | "Who am I?" self-inquiry | Ramana Maharshi, 20th c. | Adapted for reflective investigation |
| Greek philosophy | Socratic method | 5th century BCE | Applied to health beliefs and assumptions |
| Ignatian spirituality | Daily Examen | 16th century | Adapted for healing review across belief systems |
| Modern psychology | ACT cognitive defusion | 1999 | Evidence-based metacognitive techniques |
| Philosophical counseling | Philosophical dialogue | Achenbach, 1981 | Philosophical inquiry applied to personal distress |
| Tibetan Buddhist | Dzogchen pointing-out instructions | Ancient | **REFERENCE ONLY** — closed tradition |

:::danger Dzogchen Is a Closed Tradition
Dzogchen requires empowerment from a qualified teacher. The skill references Dzogchen as an example of contemplative inquiry tradition but **NEVER teaches, guides, or reproduces** its practices. Users interested in Dzogchen should seek qualified teachers in recognized lineages (Nyingma, Bon).

## Agents

- **Contemplative Inquiry Guide** — Progressive inquiry protocol design with safety scaffolding
- **Traditions Scholar** — Zen, Advaita, Socratic, Ignatian context and attribution
- **Clinical Researcher** — ACT/cognitive defusion research, meditation adverse effects
- **Language Awareness Guide** — Deautomatization protocols that precede inquiry
- **Ethics Guardian** — Psychological safety, closed tradition boundaries, grounding adequacy

## Usage

**Beginner structured reflection:**
```bash
/contemplative-inquiry "what does healing mean to me?" --level structured-reflection
```

**Socratic questioning of health beliefs:**
```bash
/contemplative-inquiry "examining my assumptions about recovery" --level guided-questioning
```

**Ignatian-style daily healing review:**
```bash
/contemplative-inquiry "daily review practice" --type examen
```

## Example: Level 1 Structured Reflection

A typical beginner session:

1. **Extended settling/grounding** (5 min) — more than other practice types
2. **Question presentation:** "What does healing mean to you?" — concrete, accessible, bounded
3. **Sitting with the question** (3-5 min) — noticing thoughts, feelings, body sensations
4. **Noticing responses** — not judging answers, just observing them
5. **Deepening:** "Is there anything else? What might healing mean that you haven't considered?"
6. **Integration:** What, if anything, has shifted?
7. **Full grounding:** Name, date, place, physical sensation, water

## Evidence Summary

> **Evidence level: Strong (for ACT/cognitive defusion), Moderate (for inquiry-based practices)**
>
> ACT/Cognitive defusion: Strong evidence base (Hayes et al., 1999+). Metacognitive therapy: Strong evidence for worry and rumination. Socratic questioning in cognitive therapy: Strong evidence as component of CBT (Beck, 1976). Philosophical counseling: Preliminary evidence as standalone. Meditation-based inquiry: Limited direct research; supported by broader meditation evidence.

## Safety Considerations

:::danger Critical Safety
- Deep questioning about identity, suffering, and meaning can temporarily change how you experience yourself and reality. This should not persist.
- ALWAYS have grounding techniques ready before starting
- STOP any practice that causes panic, severe disorientation, persistent depersonalization, or loss of contact with reality
- Do not practice during acute mental health crises
- If a question feels destabilizing, return to your breath
:::

**Contraindications:** Active psychosis, dissociative disorders, severe depersonalization/derealization, severe depression without therapeutic support (inquiry can become rumination), PTSD without support, mania, active suicidal ideation, acute grief or existential crisis, history of adverse meditation experiences without integration.

**Grounding Protocol (End of Every Practice):**
1. Let the inquiry gently dissolve
2. Feel your feet on the floor, body in the chair
3. Hands on chest and belly, breathe naturally
4. Name 5 things you see, deliberately
5. Say your name, today's date, where you are
6. Wait until sense of self feels stable before standing
7. Glass of water. Something physical and simple.

## Ethics Framework

All contemplative inquiry content is reviewed against the [Ethics Framework](../ethics/index.mdx):

- No mystification — "reflective questioning," not "ego-shattering koan practice"
- Grounding adequacy verified (5-minute settling minimum, full grounding always)
- Progressive difficulty respected — no "Who am I?" for beginners
- Koan-*inspired* questions, not formal koan practice (requires teacher)
- Dzogchen properly marked as closed/reference-only
- Depression-state screening included
- No existential destabilization without adequate support
- "The question is the practice" — no promised answers or enlightenment
