# whm-breathwork

**Trigger:** `/whm-breathwork`

Guided Wim Hof Method breathing protocols with comprehensive safety architecture. Designs progressive breathwork sessions covering the three-phase round structure: power breaths, retention, and recovery breath.

## Agents

- **Breathwork Coach** - WHM breathing protocol design and timing calibration
- **Traditions Scholar** - Tummo and pranayama cross-tradition context
- **Clinical Researcher** - Kox et al. 2014, Muzik et al. 2018 evidence review
- **Content Writer** - Practice language and framing
- **Ethics Guardian** - Safety and evidence claims review

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `focus` | Yes | Session focus (e.g., "morning energy", "stress relief") |
| `level` | No | `beginner` (default), `intermediate`, `advanced` |
| `rounds` | No | Number of rounds (default: 3) |

## Outputs

- `breathwork-protocol.md` - Complete breathing session script
- `timing.json` - Phase timing for timer integration
- `safety-briefing.md` - Pre-session safety checklist

## Examples

**Beginner first session:**
```bash
/whm-breathwork "first session" --level beginner
```

**Advanced morning practice:**
```bash
/whm-breathwork "morning energy" --level advanced --rounds 4
```

**Stress relief session:**
```bash
/whm-breathwork "stress relief" --level intermediate
```

## Three-Phase Round Structure

Each round follows this structure:

| Phase | Description | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1. Power Breaths | Deep rhythmic breathing (30-40 breaths) | 1-2 min |
| 2. Retention | Exhale and hold (NO target times) | Self-regulated |
| 3. Recovery Breath | Deep inhale, hold 15 seconds | 15 sec |

Rounds are repeated 3-4 times per session. Rest periods between rounds allow integration.

## Safety Architecture

> **CRITICAL SAFETY RULES** (included in every protocol):
>
> - NEVER practice in or near water (pools, baths, lakes, ocean)
> - NEVER practice while driving or operating machinery
> - NEVER practice while standing (risk of syncope)
> - ALWAYS practice seated or lying on a safe surface
> - STOP if you experience severe dizziness, chest pain, or panic
> - Retention is self-regulated by the gasp reflex, never by timer targets

## Research Basis

> **Evidence level: Moderate (for immune modulation)**
>
> Kox et al. (2014, PNAS, n=24): Trained WHM practitioners showed voluntary
> activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate
> immune response. Muzik et al. (2018, NeuroImage): Identified brain mechanisms
> underlying WHM practice, including periaqueductal gray activation.
>
> Evidence for other claimed benefits varies. All protocols use appropriate
> evidence language ("may help", "research suggests").

## Quality Gates

Before output is finalized:

- Safety briefing present with all three critical warnings (water, driving, standing)
- Contraindication screening included
- Retention phase uses NO target times (self-regulated)
- Timer counts UP (elapsed time), never countdown
- "Competitive holding" framing explicitly prevented
- Evidence claims matched to actual study findings
- Medical disclaimer present
- Permission to stop at every phase
