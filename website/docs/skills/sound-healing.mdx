# sound-healing

**Triggers:** `/sound-healing` and `/sound-research`

Therapeutic sound protocols drawing from documented traditions spanning millennia. Combines vocal resonance, mantra practice, and sound-based healing with knowledge of vagal tone stimulation, psychoacoustics, and the physiological effects of self-produced sound.

## Overview

Sound healing works through the simplest instrument available to every human body: the voice. From a gentle hum to extended mantra chanting, these practices use self-produced vibration to stimulate the vagus nerve, regulate breathing, and create contemplative depth.

The skill covers the full spectrum — from passive listening practices requiring no vocal production, through humming and toning, to extended mantra and chanting practices rooted in specific traditions.

## Traditions Covered

| Tradition | Practice | Period | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Vedic | Bija mantras, Gayatri Mantra | c. 1500 BCE | Open |
| Jewish | Psalm chanting, Niggun (wordless melody) | Ancient / 18th c. CE | Open |
| Western Christian | Gregorian chant | 6th century CE | Open |
| Tibetan Buddhist | Singing bowl, overtone chanting | Ancient | Some practices closed |
| General | Humming, vagal toning, Bhramari pranayama | Cross-tradition | Open |

:::warning Closed Practice Boundaries
Some Tibetan Buddhist mantras tied to deity empowerment, sacred Indigenous songs, specific Sufi zikr practices, and initiatory guru-disciple mantras are **closed traditions** requiring lineage transmission. The skill only guides open practices and clearly marks these boundaries.

## Progressive Levels

| Level | Practice | Duration | Skill Required |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------|
| 1. Listening | Guided listening to bowls or recorded chant | 5-10 min | None |
| 2. Humming | Simple humming, Bhramari (bee breath) | 10-15 min | None |
| 3. Simple Toning | Open-vowel toning, single Om | 10-15 min | None |
| 4. Mantra Practice | Mantra with pronunciation and rhythm | 15-20 min | Minimal |
| 5. Extended Chanting | Longer sessions, mala repetition, overtones | 20-30 min | Developing |

## Agents

- **Sound Healing Guide** — Protocol design across all practice types
- **Traditions Scholar** — Historical context and open/closed practice verification
- **Clinical Researcher** — Vagal stimulation, psychoacoustic evidence review
- **Content Writer** — Practice language and framing
- **Ethics Guardian** — Safety, cultural attribution, and evidence claims review

## Usage

**Beginner humming practice:**
```bash
/sound-healing "stress relief humming" --level beginner
```

**Vedic mantra session:**
```bash
/sound-healing "Gayatri mantra practice" --level intermediate
```

**Research on sound and vagal tone:**
```bash
/sound-research "humming and vagal nerve stimulation"
```

## Example Output

A typical sound healing session includes:

- **Safety briefing** — volume, hearing, and contraindication check
- **Warm-up** (2-5 min) — gentle humming, jaw relaxation, finding a comfortable pitch
- **Core practice** (5-30 min) — specific toning, mantra, or chanting with body awareness cues
- **Silence intervals** — integration happens in the silence between sounds
- **Cool-down** — gradual reduction from sounding to humming to silence
- **Grounding** — body scan, gentle transition

## Evidence Summary

> **Evidence level: Moderate (for vagal stimulation via humming)**
>
> Kalyani et al. (2011): Om chanting activates limbic deactivation patterns consistent with vagal stimulation. Vickhoff et al. (2013): Group chanting synchronizes heart rate variability. Cochrane reviews on music therapy show moderate benefits for pain and anxiety.
>
> Evidence for specific mantra-based outcomes varies. All protocols use appropriate evidence language ("may support," "research suggests").

## Safety Considerations

:::danger Critical Safety
- Keep volume at a comfortable level — sound healing should never cause pain
- If you experience ringing in the ears (tinnitus) or ear pain, stop immediately
- Do not practice vigorous chanting with a sore throat or respiratory infection
- If you feel dizzy during extended toning, pause and breathe normally
:::

**Contraindications:** Active ear infection, tinnitus (modify to low-volume humming), sound sensitivity/hyperacusis, hearing aids (adjust before singing bowl proximity), epilepsy (some rhythmic patterns may trigger), severe anxiety or PTSD (start with soft humming only), vocal cord conditions (listening-only practices).

## Ethics Framework

All sound healing content is reviewed against the [Ethics Framework](../ethics/index.mdx):

- Every mantra and chant is attributed to its tradition of origin
- Open vs. closed practice status verified before inclusion
- No "frequency healing," "DNA activation," or pseudoscientific claims
- Physiological effects (vagal tone, respiratory pacing) presented honestly
- No musical skill or experience required — "There is no wrong note"
