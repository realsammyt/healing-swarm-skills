# coherence-meditation

**Trigger:** `/coherence-meditation`

Guided 20-minute interhemispheric coherence practices based on Grinberg's self-allusive meditation protocol.

## Agents

- **Consciousness Researcher** - Grinberg research and EEG coherence evidence
- **Coherence Guide** - Self-allusive meditation practice design
- **Content Writer** - Practice language and framing
- **Ethics Guardian** - Safety and evidence claims review

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `focus` | Yes | Focus area (e.g., "morning coherence", "stress reduction") |
| `level` | No | `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced` |
| `duration` | No | `10`, `20` (default), `30` minutes |

## Outputs

- `coherence-practice.md` - Complete guided meditation script
- `evidence-brief.md` - Research context with honest limitations
- `audio-timing.json` - Timing cues for audio recording

## Examples

**Beginner morning practice:**
```bash
/coherence-meditation "morning coherence" --level beginner
```

**Advanced healing support:**
```bash
/coherence-meditation "healing support" --level advanced --duration 30
```

**Quick stress reduction:**
```bash
/coherence-meditation "stress relief" --duration 10
```

## Practice Structure

Based on Grinberg's 6-phase self-allusive meditation protocol:

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 1. Settling | 2-3 min | Grounding, initial awareness |
| 2. Body Awareness | 4-5 min | Physical sensations, interoception |
| 3. Emotional Field | 4-5 min | Emotions without losing body awareness |
| 4. Thought Awareness | 4-5 min | Observing mental patterns |
| 5. Unified Field | 4-5 min | All domains simultaneously ("high-inclusion") |
| 6. Integration | 2-3 min | Grounding, return |

Each phase **adds** to previous awareness rather than replacing it. The unified field phase — holding body, emotion, thought, and environment simultaneously — is the distinctive feature.

## Research Basis

> **Evidence level: Preliminary**
>
> Grinberg's EEG studies at UNAM suggest that self-allusive meditation may enhance
> interhemispheric coherence (alpha 8-12 Hz and theta 4-8 Hz synchronization).
> These findings are based on small sample sizes with limited independent
> replication. Broader meditation neuroscience provides moderate support for
> meditation-related EEG changes.

## Quality Gates

Before output is finalized:

- 6-phase structure followed correctly
- Evidence levels clearly labeled
- Grinberg properly attributed (UNAM, 1970s-1994)
- Small sample sizes and limited replication noted
- "Suggests" language used, never "proves"
- Medical disclaimer present
- Permission to stop included at every phase
- Variations for accessibility provided
