description: Body-based healing practices — gentle movement protocols, somatic awareness, and movement as medicine across traditions

# somatic-movement

**Triggers:** `/somatic-practice` and `/walking-meditation`

Gentle, therapeutic movement protocols that use the body as a pathway to nervous system regulation and healing. Draws on somatic awareness, mindful movement traditions, and polyvagal theory to create practices accessible to every body.

## Overview

Somatic movement healing begins with the premise that the body is not a problem to solve — it is the pathway to healing. From a simple body scan requiring no movement at all, through gentle joint circles, to flowing tai chi sequences, these practices build body awareness, regulate the nervous system, and restore a felt sense of safety.

Every practice includes standing, seated, lying, and wheelchair modifications. No exceptions.

## Traditions Covered

| Tradition | Practice | Period | Focus |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------|
| Traditional Chinese Medicine | Qigong, Zhan Zhuang | c. 300 BCE | Energy cultivation, standing meditation |
| Chinese martial/contemplative | Tai chi | 16th century CE | Flowing movement sequences |
| Indian contemplative | Yoga asana, Hatha yoga | c. 500 CE | Breath-movement coordination |
| Zen Buddhist | Kinhin (walking meditation) | Ancient | Breath-synchronized walking |
| Modern Western somatic | Feldenkrais, Alexander Technique | 20th century | Somatic awareness, movement re-education |

## Progressive Levels

| Level | Practice | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| 1. Body Scan | Guided attention through body regions | 10-15 min | Interoceptive awareness |
| 2. Micro-Movements | Finger, toe, head, shoulder movements | 10-15 min | Reconnecting with safe movement |
| 3. Gentle Movement | Joint circles, seated spinal work, stretching | 15-20 min | Breath-movement coordination |
| 4. Coordinated Sequences | Simple qigong, basic tai chi, walking meditation | 20-30 min | Flow, rhythm, moving meditation |
| 5. Flowing Practice | Extended sequences, free-form somatic exploration | 25-45 min | Embodied awareness, sustained practice |

## Agents

- **Somatic / Movement Guide** — Protocol design with full accessibility modifications
- **Traditions Scholar** — Historical context for qigong, tai chi, yoga, kinhin
- **Clinical Researcher** — Polyvagal theory, movement therapy evidence
- **Content Writer** — Practice language polishing
- **Ethics Guardian** — Safety, accessibility completeness, and cultural attribution

## Usage

**Beginner desk worker practice:**
```bash
/somatic-practice "gentle movement for desk workers" --level beginner
```

**Walking meditation:**
```bash
/walking-meditation "morning kinhin practice" --duration 20
```

**Chair-based qigong:**
```bash
/somatic-practice "seated qigong" --level intermediate --position seated
```

:::tip Radical Accessibility
Every single practice produced by this skill includes **four position variants**: standing, seated (chair), lying down, and wheelchair. This is not optional — it is built into every protocol at every level. "Every body can practice" is the cardinal principle.
:::

## Evidence Summary

> **Evidence level: Moderate to Strong (varies by practice)**
>
> Tai chi: Strong evidence for balance improvement in older adults (Cochrane review). Moderate evidence for chronic pain, anxiety, and depression. Yoga: Strong evidence for low back pain (Cochrane), moderate for anxiety and depression. Qigong: Moderate evidence for chronic pain and quality of life. Walking meditation: Moderate evidence for mood and cardiovascular benefits.
>
> Polyvagal Theory (Porges, 1994) provides a useful clinical framework, though some aspects remain debated in the neuroscience literature.

## Safety Considerations

:::warning Movement Safety
- Move within comfort — NEVER through pain
- If any movement causes pain, skip it or reduce the range
- You can always rest — stopping is smart, not failure
- If you feel dizzy when standing, sit down immediately
- Stay hydrated
:::

**Contraindications:** Recent surgery (seek clearance), acute injury or inflammation, severe osteoporosis (avoid twisting/forward bending), uncontrolled cardiovascular condition, acute disc herniation, balance disorders (practice seated or with wall support), pregnancy (modify positions), active joint infection.

## Ethics Framework

All somatic movement content is reviewed against the [Ethics Framework](../ethics/index.mdx):

- Qigong is Chinese. Yoga is Indian. Tai chi is Chinese. Kinhin is Japanese. Named every time
- No pain-pushing language — "Move within comfort, never through pain"
- Body-affirming framing — "Explore how this feels for your body," not rigid alignment standards
- Descriptions in words, not just images — screen readers cannot see poses
- Performance framing rejected — "This is awareness, not exercise"
