# grief-healing

**Trigger:** `/grief-healing`

Contemplative and ritual practices that support people processing loss of all kinds — bereavement, health, identity, relationship, and life transitions. Combines grief psychology, mourning traditions across cultures, and trauma-sensitive facilitation with the highest psychological safety standards in the system.

## Overview

Grief is not a disorder to be treated. It is a natural human response to loss that deserves witness, space, and time. This skill creates practices that hold grief without trying to fix it — from gentle acknowledgment of loss through sitting with grief to meaning-making and integration.

The skill never imposes timelines, stages, or expectations. It never suggests "moving on" or "getting over" loss. It explicitly recognizes that loss of health, mobility, or ability is grief deserving the same compassion as any other form of loss.

## The Grief Companionship Model

```
Acknowledging (What has been lost?)
  | when ready
Sitting With (Can I be present with this grief?)
  | when ready
Ritualizing (How do I mark and honor this loss?)
  | when ready
Meaning-Making (How does this loss live in my life story?)
  | when ready
Integration (How do I carry this forward with tenderness?)
```

Progression is guided **entirely** by the griever's readiness. There is no timeline. Someone may stay at "Acknowledging" for months. Someone may move through all phases in weeks. Both are right.

## Traditions Covered

| Tradition | Practice | Focus |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Jewish | Shiva, Shloshim, Yahrzeit, Kaddish, Keriah | Structured time-based mourning with community |
| Buddhist | Maranasati, Five Remembrances | Impermanence as path to presence |
| Mexican | Dia de los Muertos, ofrendas | Continuing bonds through celebration |
| Celtic | Keening (caoineadh), threshold tending | Vocal lamentation, giving grief a sound |
| Tibetan Buddhist | Bardo practices (educational reference) | Understanding of death and transition |

## Evidence Summary

> **Evidence level: Strong (for grief counseling and social support)**
>
> Currier et al. (2008): Grief counseling effective for complicated grief. Klass, Silverman & Nickman (1996): Continuing bonds theory — maintaining connection supports adjustment. Stroebe et al. (2005): Social support is the strongest predictor of grief adjustment. Thieleman & Cacciatore (2014): Mindfulness-based grief interventions reduce symptoms.
>
> Meaning-making in bereavement: Moderate evidence (Davis et al., 1998). All protocols use appropriate language.

## Safety Considerations

**Distinguishing normal grief from complicated grief:**

| Normal Grief (support with practices) | Refer to Professional When |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Waves of emotion that gradually become less frequent | Grief intensifying after 12+ months |
| Ability to function, even if impaired | Persistent inability to function |
| Gradual re-engagement with activities | Persistent suicidal ideation |
| Moments of joy alongside grief | Complete withdrawal from all relationships |
| Dreams or thoughts of the lost | Substance use escalating in response |

**Language never used:** "Everything happens for a reason," "They're in a better place," "At least...," "You should be grateful for...," "It's time to move on," "Stay strong."

**Language always used:** "This is hard. You don't have to make it make sense." "Your grief shows how much this mattered." "There is no timeline for this." "Whatever you're feeling is valid."

## Ethics Framework
