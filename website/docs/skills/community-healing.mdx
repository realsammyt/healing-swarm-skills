# community-healing

**Triggers:** `/community-healing` and `/relational-practice`

Group healing practices, healing circles, and community-based contemplative experiences. Combines deep understanding of group dynamics, consent frameworks, power structures, and the ethics of shared vulnerability with tradition-informed group practice design.

## Overview

We heal in relationship. The evidence for social connection and health outcomes is among the strongest in all of medicine (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010). This skill designs group healing practices that create the conditions for connection, witnessing, and shared presence — while maintaining rigorous safety, consent, and confidentiality standards.

These are contemplative practices, not group therapy. Active trauma, severe mental health conditions, and clinical needs belong in professional settings.

## The Progressive Group Model

```
Dyad (2 people)
  | builds comfort and skill
Small Group (4-6 people)
  | builds trust and practice
Larger Circle (8-12 people)
  | builds community
Community Gathering (12+ people)
```

Groups should not start large. Begin with dyads and small groups. Larger circles require participants with group contemplative experience. Community gatherings require multiple trained facilitators.

## Traditions Covered

| Tradition | Practice | Key Principle |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Indigenous (various) | Talking circles | Each voice equally valued; talking piece |
| Jewish | Mussar groups, Chevruta, Va'ad | Mutual accountability, ethical growth |
| Buddhist | Sangha practice | Community as one of the Three Jewels |
| Quaker | Silent worship / Meeting for worship | Gathered silence; speech as exception |
| Southern African | Ubuntu philosophy | "I am because we are" |
| Modern | 12-Step traditions | Peer support, anonymity, no advice-giving |

:::warning Indigenous Practice Attribution
Talking circles are living, owned traditions of Indigenous peoples. When adapting principles, the skill always: acknowledges Indigenous ownership, distinguishes "inspired by" from "practicing," never claims to offer an Indigenous ceremony, and defers to Indigenous practitioners for authentic practice.

## Facilitator Requirements

:::danger Trained Facilitation Required
Group healing practices are **NOT self-running**. Every protocol requires a trained facilitator who:
- Is NOT also a participant (cannot hold space and go deep simultaneously)
- Has experience with contemplative practice
- Is trained in basic group dynamics and distress response
- Knows when to pause, redirect, or end a session
- Has a plan for participants who need individual support
- Co-facilitators recommended for groups of 8+
:::

## Consent Framework

All group practices include consent that is read aloud before every session:

> "This practice involves [description]. You are invited to participate fully, but you are never required to share, speak, or do anything that does not feel right for you.
>
> Your rights: You may pass on any prompt. You may leave at any time. What you share here stays here. You own your experience. You may ask for what you need."

- Explicit verbal consent from EACH participant
- Consent checked again before each new phase
- Non-verbal distress signals established
- "Silence is a form of participation"

## Agents

- **Community Facilitator** — Group protocol design with consent and power-awareness
- **Traditions Scholar** — Talking circles, Sangha, Mussar, Quaker, Ubuntu context
- **Clinical Researcher** — Social support evidence, group dynamics research
- **Content Writer** — Facilitator scripts and participant guides
- **Ethics Guardian** — Enhanced review: consent, power dynamics, confidentiality, facilitator requirements

## Usage

**Dyad practice for pairs:**
```bash
/relational-practice "partner witnessing exercise" --size 2
```

**Small healing circle:**
```bash
/community-healing "gratitude circle" --size 6 --context "first meeting"
```

**Large group facilitator guide:**
```bash
/community-healing "community gathering" --size 15 --facilitators 2
```

## Evidence Summary

> **Evidence level: Very Strong (for social support and health)**
>
> Holt-Lunstad et al. (2010): Social support consistently predicts better health outcomes across conditions. Holt-Lunstad et al. (2015): Social isolation associated with significantly increased mortality risk. Burlingame et al. (2004): Group therapy comparable to individual therapy for many conditions. Khoury et al. (2013): MBSR and MBCT in group format well-supported. Kelly et al. (2020): Active 12-Step participation associated with sustained recovery.

## Safety Considerations

**Group-specific risks and mitigations:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Scapegoating | Facilitator monitors, redirects |
| Pressure to disclose | "You may pass" stated explicitly and often |
| Boundary violations | No unsolicited advice, touch, or interpretation |
| Power dynamics | Mapped before pairing/grouping, adjusted for |
| Emotional contagion | Facilitator monitors, has grounding ready |
| Re-traumatization | These are NOT therapy groups — redirect to professional |
| Dependency | Complement, not substitute for professional support |

**Facilitator self-care is required, not optional.** Facilitators absorb emotional energy from the group. Centering before, grounding during, debrief after, and ongoing peer support are built into every protocol.

## Ethics Framework

All community healing content receives **enhanced ethics review** against the [Ethics Framework](../ethics/index.mdx):

- Consent framework adequacy verified for every protocol
- Power dynamic assessment built into every group design
- Confidentiality explicitly established and agreed by ALL
- Facilitator requirement enforced — no self-running groups
- "Share your experience, not your solutions" as stated guideline
- Cultural context respected — group norms vary by culture
- Connection not forced — "shared presence is the practice, not connection"
