# Skills Reference

The healing swarm provides skills for the complete development lifecycle—build new healing applications from scratch, or add healing properties to existing projects.

> Muzik et al. 2018) with proper safety architecture. All protocols include
> comprehensive contraindication screening and never practice near water warnings.

### Language Awareness Skills (Cognitive Deautomatization)

> (Deikman 1966), semantic satiation studies, and Chase Hughes' *Tongue* (2024),
> with cross-tradition parallels from Zen, Dzogchen, and phenomenology. All
> protocols include psychological safety framing and grounding anchors.

### Sound & Vibratory Healing

> Tibetan singing bowl, and vagal toning. All protocols screen for hearing
> conditions and respect open/closed practice boundaries.

### Somatic & Movement Healing

|-------|---------|---------|
| [Somatic Movement](./somatic-movement.mdx) | `/somatic-practice` | Gentle movement protocols — qigong, tai chi, yoga, walking meditation |

> **Note:** Every somatic practice includes standing, seated, lying, and wheelchair
> modifications. Movement is within comfort, never through pain. Traditions
> include qigong, tai chi, yoga, kinhin, and Feldenkrais.

| [Sleep Healing](./sleep-healing.mdx) | `/sleep-healing` | Evening wind-down, bedtime meditation, dream journaling |

> **Note:** Sleep healing includes Asclepian dream temples, Tibetan dream yoga,
> TCM organ clock, and Ayurvedic dinacharya traditions. The screen paradox
> (device-delivered sleep guidance) is addressed honestly in every protocol.

### Nature-Based Healing

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [Nature Healing](./nature-healing.mdx) | `/nature-healing` | Shinrin-yoku, earthing, garden therapy, Five Element observation |

> **Note:** 60+ forest bathing studies support this practice. Urban and indoor
> alternatives are always available — never as "lesser" options. Environmental
> privilege is acknowledged explicitly.

### Water & Hydrotherapy

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [Water Healing](./water-healing.mdx) | `/water-healing` | Contrast therapy, Kneipp method, ritual bathing education |

> **Note:** Extends the existing cold exposure skill into warm water, contrast
> therapy, and cultural context. Drowning and cardiac risk warnings are
> non-negotiable in every protocol.

### Grief & Bereavement Healing

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [Grief Healing](./grief-healing.mdx) | `/grief-healing` | Grief-informed practices across mourning traditions |

> ideation screening. Jewish mourning, Buddhist impermanence, Dia de los
> Muertos, and Celtic keening traditions are represented.

### Expressive & Creative Healing

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [Expressive Healing](./expressive-healing.mdx) | `/expressive-healing` | Pennebaker writing, bibliotherapy, art-as-process |

> confidentiality agreements, and power dynamic awareness are built into every
> protocol. Traditions include Mussar, Sangha, Ubuntu, and 12-Step.

### Contemplative Inquiry

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [Contemplative Inquiry](./contemplative-inquiry.mdx) | `/contemplative-inquiry` | Zen koan, Advaitic self-inquiry, Socratic questioning, Ignatian Examen |

> **Note:** Extends language awareness into deeper investigation. Progressive
> levels from structured reflection to silent investigation. Dzogchen is
> noted as a closed tradition (reference only, never taught).

### PNI Research Bridge

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [PNI Research](./pni-research.mdx) | `/pni-research` | Mind-body-immune science bridging traditions and biology |

> **Note:** PNI strengthens the evidence base for all other skills by mapping
> traditional healing claims to documented biological pathways (HPA axis,
> vagal tone, telomeres, placebo mechanisms, wound healing).

### Safety Infrastructure (P0)

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Safety Infrastructure](./safety-infrastructure.mdx) | Crisis response, contraindications, outcome measurement, practice pathways |

> **Note:** The safety layer underpinning every skill. Includes the
> contraindication database, crisis response protocols, outcome measurement
> framework, and cross-skill integration pathways.
