# Skills Reference

The healing swarm provides skills for the complete development lifecycle—build new healing applications from scratch, or add healing properties to existing projects.

---

## Skills Overview

### Development Skills (Build New)

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [Research](./research.mdx) | `/healing-research` | Deep research into healing traditions and clinical evidence |
| [Design](./design.mdx) | `/healing-design` | Design healing application UX and visuals |
| [Content](./content.mdx) | `/healing-content` | Create prayers, evidence boxes, visualizations |
| [Build](./build.mdx) | `/healing-build` | Develop accessible, privacy-first applications |
| [Review](./review.mdx) | `/healing-review` | Quality review (ethics, clinical, cultural, a11y) |
| [Deploy](./deploy.mdx) | `/healing-deploy` | Deploy and maintain applications |
| [Swarm](./swarm.mdx) | `/healing-swarm` | Full orchestrated development lifecycle |

### Integration Skills (Upgrade Existing)

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [Integration](./integration.mdx) | `/healing-integrate` | Add healing properties to any existing project |

**Specialized Integration Patterns:**

| Pattern | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| [Project Analysis](/docs/integration/project-analysis) | AI-powered HEAL assessment of any codebase |
| [Healing Gamification](/docs/integration/healing-gamification) | Non-manipulative engagement mechanics |
| [Narrative Healing](/docs/integration/narrative-healing) | Interactive fiction and visual novels |
| [Game Healing](/docs/integration/game-healing) | Video game wellness mechanics |

### Consciousness Skills (Grinberg Research)

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [Coherence Meditation](./coherence.mdx) | `/coherence-meditation` | Guided interhemispheric coherence practices |
| [Syntergic Research](./syntergic-research.mdx) | `/syntergic-research` | Deep research into Grinberg's consciousness science |
| [Resonance Pairing](./resonance.mdx) | `/resonance-pairing` | Paired/group transferred potential protocols |
| [Orbital Journey](./orbital-journey.mdx) | `/orbital-journey` | Progressive multi-day consciousness expansion |

> **Note:** Consciousness skills are based on the preliminary research of
> Dr. Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum (UNAM, 1970s-1994). All content produced
> by these skills includes explicit evidence-level labeling and safety framing.

### Breathwork Skills (Wim Hof Method)

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [WHM Breathwork](./whm-breathwork.mdx) | `/whm-breathwork` | Guided WHM breathing protocols with safety architecture |
| [WHM Cold Exposure](./whm-cold-exposure.mdx) | `/whm-cold-exposure` | Progressive cold adaptation protocols |
| [WHM Journey](./whm-journey.mdx) | `/whm-journey` | Multi-week integrated WHM program (all 3 pillars) |

> **Note:** Breathwork skills are based on Wim Hof Method research (Kox et al. 2014,
> Muzik et al. 2018) with proper safety architecture. All protocols include
> comprehensive contraindication screening and never practice near water warnings.

### Language Awareness Skills (Cognitive Deautomatization)

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [Language Awareness](./language-awareness.mdx) | `/language-awareness` | Individual cognitive deautomatization practices |
| [Group Perception](./group-perception.mdx) | `/group-perception` | Group perception exercises with consent frameworks |

> **Note:** Language awareness skills draw on cognitive deautomatization research
> (Deikman 1966), semantic satiation studies, and Chase Hughes' *Tongue* (2024),
> with cross-tradition parallels from Zen, Dzogchen, and phenomenology. All
> protocols include psychological safety framing and grounding anchors.

### Standalone Skills

These are single-agent skills for targeted tasks:

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Traditions Research | `/traditions-research` | Research specific healing traditions |
| Clinical Research | `/clinical-research` | Systematic clinical evidence review |
| Mechanism Mapping | `/mechanism-mapping` | Bridge traditional concepts with neuroscience |
| Healing UX | `/healing-ux` | UX design for healing contexts |
| Sacred Visuals | `/sacred-visuals` | Healing visual system design |
| Ethics Review | `/ethics-review` | Ethics and safety review (veto power) |
| Clinical Review | `/clinical-review` | Verify clinical claims and citations |
| Cultural Review | `/cultural-review` | Cultural sensitivity review |
| Accessibility Audit | `/a11y-audit` | WCAG and healing-specific accessibility |
